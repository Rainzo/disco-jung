THE YEARS, OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU, 
when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time 
of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. 

It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. 
My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from 
the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream 
and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more 
than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer 
classification, the scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. 


But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then. 


C..G. JUNG, 1957 


Preface 


Since 1962, the existence of C. G, Jung's Red Book has been widely known. Yet only with the present publication 
is it finally accessible to a broad public, Its genesis is described in Jung's Memories, Dreams, Reflections, and has been 
the subject of numerous discussions in the secondary literature. Hence | will only briefly outline it here. 

The year 1913 was pivotal in Jung's life. He began a self-experiment that became known as his “confrontation 
with the unconscious” and lasted until 1930. During this experiment, he developed a technique to “get to the bottom 
of [his] inner processes,” “to translate the emotions into images,” and “to grasp the fantasies which were stirring 
‘underground. He later called this method “active imagination.” He first recorded these fantasies in his Black Books 
He then revised these texts, added reflections on them, and copied them in a calligraphic script into a book entitled 
Liber Novus bound in red leather, accompanied by his own paintings. It has always been known as the Red Book. 

Jung shared his inner experiences with his wife and close associates. In 1925 he gave a report of his professional 
and personal development in a series of seminars at the Psychological Club in Ziirich in which he also mentioned 
his method of active imagination. Beyond this, Jung was guarded. His children, for example, were not informed 
about his self-experiment and they did not notice anything unusual. Clearly, it would have been difficult for him 





to explain what was taking place. It was already a mark of favor if he allowed one of his children to watch him 
write or paint. Thus for Jung's descendants, the Red Book had always been surrounded by an aura of mystery. In 
1930 Jung ended his experiment and put the Red Book aside—unfinished. Although it had its honored place in his 
study, he let it rest for decades. Meanwhile the insights he had gained through it directly informed his subsequent 
writings. In 1959, with the help of the old draft, he tried to complete the transcription of the text into the Red Book 
and to finish an incomplete painting, He also started on an epilogue, but for unknown reasons both the calligraphic 
text and epilogue break off in midsentence. 

Although Jung actively considered publishing the Red Book, he never took the necessary steps. In 1916 he privately 
published the Septem Sermones ad Mortuos (Seven Sermons to the Dead), a short work that arose out of his confrontation 
with the unconscious. Even his 1916 essay, “The Transcendent Function,” in which he described the technique of 
active imagination, was not published until 1958. There are a number of reasons why he did not publish the Red 
Book. As he himself stated, it was unfinished. His growing interest in alchemy as a research topic distracted him 
In hindsight, he described the detailed working out of his fantasies in the Red Book as a necessary but annoying 
“aestheticizing elaboration.” As late as 1957 he declared that the Black Books and the Red Book were autobiographical 
records that he did not want published in his Collected Works because they were not of a scholarly character. As a 
concession, he allowed Aniela Jaffe to quote excerpts from the Red Book and the Black Books in Memories, Dreams, 
Reflections~a possibility which she made little use of. 

In 1961, Jung died. His literary estate became the property of his descendants, who formed the Society of Heirs 
of C. G. Jung, The inheritance of Jung's literary rights brought an obligation and challenge to his heirs: to see 
through the publication of the German edition of his Collected Works. In his will, Jung had expressed the wish that 
the Red Book and the Black Books should remain with his family, without, however, giving more detailed instructions 
Since the Red Book was not meant to be published in the Collected Works, the Society of Heirs concluded that this 
was Jung's final wish concerning the work, and that it was an entirely private matter. The Society of Heirs guarded 
Jung's unpublished writings like a treasure; no further publications were considered. The Red Book remained in 
Jung's study for more than twenty years, entrusted to the care of Franz Jung, who had taken over his father’s house 

In 1983 the Society of Heirs placed the Red Book in a safe-deposit box, knowing that it was an irreplaceable 
document. In 1984 the newly appointed executive committee had five photographic duplicates made for family 


use. For the first time, Jung's descendants now had the opportunity to take a close look at it. This careful handling 





had its benefits. The Red Book's well-preserved state is due, among other things, to the fact that it has only rarely 
been opened in decades. 


Vil 


When, after 1990, the editing of the German Collected Works—a selection of works—was drawing to a conclusion, 
the executive committee decided to start looking through all the accessible unpublished material with an eye to 
further publications. I took up this task, because in 1994, the Society of Heirs had placed the responsibility for 
archival and editorial questions on me. It turned out that there was an entire corpus of drafts and variants pertaining 
to the Red Book, From this it emerged that the missing part of the calligraphic text existed as a draft and that there 
was a manuscript entitled “Scrutinies,” which continued where the draft ended, containing the Seven Sermons. Yet 
whether and how this substantial material could be published remained an open question. At first glance, the style 
and content appeared to have little in common with Jung's other works. Much was unclear and by the mid-1990s 
there was no one left who could have provided first-hand information on these points. 

However, since Jung’s time, the history of psychology had been gaining in importance and could now offer a new 
approach. While working on other projects | had come in contact with Sonu Shamdasani. In extensive talks we 
discussed the possibility of further Jung publications, both in general terms as well as with regard to the Red Book. 
The book had emerged within a specific context with which a reader at the turn of the twenty-first century is no 
longer familiar. But a historian of psychology would be able to present it to the modern reader as a historical 
document. With the help of primary sources he could embed it in the cultural context of its genesis, situate it 
within the history of science, and relate it to Jung’s life and works. In 1999 Sonu Shamdasani developed a 
publication proposal following these guiding principles. On the basis of this proposal the Society of Heirs 
decided in spring 2000—not without discussion—to release the Red Book for publication and to hand over the 
task of editing it to Sonu Shamdasani. 

I have been asked repeatedly why, after so many years, the Red Book is now being published. Some new 
understandings on our part played a major role: Jung himself did not—as it had seemed—consider the Red Book a 
secret. On several occasions the text contains the address “dear friends’; it is, in other words, directed at an 
audience. Indeed, Jung let close friends have copies of transcriptions and discussed these with them. He did not 
categorically rule out publication; he simply left the issue unresolved. Moreover, Jung himself stated that he had 
gained the material for all his later works from his confrontation with the unconscious. As a record of this 
confrontation the Red Book is thus, beyond the private sphere, central to Jung’s works. This understanding allowed 
the generation of Jung's grandchildren to look at the situation in a new light. The decision-making process took 
time. Exemplary excerpts, concepts, and information helped them to deal more rationally with an emotionally 
charged matter. Finally, the Society of Heirs decided democratically that the Red Book could be published. It was 
a long journey from that decision to the present publication. The result is impressive. This edition would not have 
been possible without the cooperation of many people who devoted their skill and energy to a common goal. 
On behalf of the descendants of C. G. Jung, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the contributors.

To facilitate moving between the facsimile and the translation, the following devices are used 


In the Liber Primus translation, the numbers at the end of the left-hand running head refer to the folios 
of the facsimile. For instance, fol. ii(v)/fol. iii(r) indicates the material in the translation is from folio ii, 
verso, and folio iii, recto, of the facsimile. The break from one page to the next in the facsimile is indicated 
by a red slash / in the text of the translation and the folio numbers divided by a red slash in the margins 
of the page. 


In Liber Secundus, page numbers are used. 3/5 in the running head refers to pages 3 through 5 of the 
facsimile. A red slash in the text and 3/4 in the margin indicate the break between pages 3 and 4 of 
the facsimile. 


Acknowledgments 


Given the unpublished copies in circulation, the Red Book would in all likelihood have eventually entered the 
public domain at some stage, in some form. In what follows, I would like to thank those who have enabled the 
present historical edition to come about. A number of people collaborated and they have each in their own way 
contributed to its realization. 

The former Society of Heirs of C. G. Jung (dissolved in 2008) decided in spring 2000 after intensive 
discussion to release the work for publication. On the behalf of the Society of Heirs, Ulrich Hoerni, formerly 
its manager and president and presently the president of its successor, the Foundation of the Works of C. G. Jung, 
planned the project with the support of the executive committee. Wolfgang Baumann, president from 2000 to 
2004, signed the agreement in autumn 2000 that made possible the commencement of the work and committed 
the Society of Heirs to underwrite a major part of the costs. The Foundation of the Works of C. G. Jung would 
like to thank: Heinrich Zweifel, publisher, Ziirich, for advice in the planning phase on technical issues; The 
Donald Cooper Fund of the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology for a significant donation; Rolf Auf der Maur 
for legal advice and contractual assistance; Leo La Rosa and Peter Fritz for contractual negotiations. 

Ata critical moment in 2003, the editorial work was supported by the Bogette Foundation and an anonymous 
donor. From 2004, the editorial work was supported by the Philemon Foundation, an organization established 
with the sole purpose of raising funds to enable Jung's unpublished works to see the light of day. In this regard, I 
am indebted to Stephen Martin, Whatever the shortcomings of this edition, the editorial apparatus and the 
translation could not have attained anything like the current level without the support of the Board of the 
Philemon Foundation: Tom Charlesworth, Gilda Frantz, Judith Harris, James Hollis, Stephen Martin, and 
Eugene Taylor. The Philemon Foundation would like to acknowledge the support of its donors, in particular 
Carolyn Grant Fay and Judith Harris, and significant gifts toward the English translation from Nancy Furlotti 
and Laurence de Rosen. 

My work on this project would not have been possible without the support of Maggie Baron and Ximena Roelli 
de Angulo through numerous tribulations. It commenced and was made possible by research on the intellectual 
history of Jung’s work sponsored by the Wellcome Trust between 1993 and 1998, by the Institut fiir Grenzgebiete 
der Psychologie in 1999, and the Solon Foundation between 1998 and 2001. Throughout the project, the 
Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London (formerly the Wellcome 
Institute for the History of Medicine) has been an ideal environment for my research. Confidentiality agreements 
precluded discussing my work on this project with my friends and colleagues: | thank them for their forbearance 
over the last thirteen years. 

Between late 2000 and early 2003 the Society of Heirs of C. G. Jung supported the editorial work, which 
initiated the project. Ulrich Hoerni collaborted with aspects of the research and made a corrected transcription 
of the calligraphic volume. Susanne Hoerni transcribed Jung's Black Books. Presentations were made to members 
of the Jung family in 1999, 2001, and 2003, which were hosted by Helene Hoerni Jung (1999, 2001) and Andreas 
and Vreni Jung (2003). Peter Jung provided counsel through the publication deliberations and early stages of the 
editorial work. Andreas and Vreni Jung assisted during countless visits to consult books and manuscripts in Jung's 
library, and Andreas Jung provided invaluable information from the Jung family archives. 

This edition came about through Nancy Furlotti, and Larry and Sandra Vigon, who led me to Jim Mairs at 
Norton, who had been responsible for the facsimile edition of Larry Vigon’s modern-day Liber Novus, Dream. In 
Jim Mairs, the work could not have found a better editor. The design and layout of the work provided numerous 


XI 


challenges, elegantly resolved by Eric Baker, Larry Vigon, and Amy Wu Carol Rose was tireless and ever-vigilant 
in copyediting the text. Austin O’Driscoll was of continuous assistance. The calligraphic volume was scanned by 
Hugh Milstein and John Supra of Digital Fusion. The care and the precision of their work (focusing via sonar) 
met with and matched the care and precision of Jung's calligraphy in a remarkable fusion of the ancient and the 
modern. Dennis Savini made his photographic studio available for the scanning. At Mondadori Printing Nancy 
Freeman, Sergio Brunelli, and their colleagues took great care to ensure that the work was printed to the highest 
standards technically possible 

From 2006, I was joined by Mark Kyburz and John Peck on the translation—a collaboration that was a 
privileged instruction in the art of translation. Our regular conference calls provided the welcome opportunity 
to discuss the text at a microscopic level, and the humor brought much-needed levity to the constant immersion 
in the spirit of the depths. Their contributions to the later stages of the editorial work have been invaluable 
John Peck picked up several significant allusions that were beyond my ken. 

Ximena Roelli de Angulo, Helene Hoerni Jung, Pierre Keller, and the late Leonhard Schlegel provided crucial 
recollections of the atmosphere in Jung's circle in the twenties, and figures involved in it Leonhard Schlegel provided 
critical insights into the Dada movement and the collisions between art and psychology in this period 

Erik Hornung provided consultation concerning Egyptological references. Felix Walder assisted with a digital 
close-up of image 155, Ulrich Hoerni deciphered its small inscriptions, and Guy Attewell recognized the arabic 
inscription. Ulrich Hoerni provided references to the Mithraic Liturgy (note 1, p. 367). David Oswald pointed to 
the Mutus Liber as Jung’s possible referent in note 314 (p. 328). Thomas Feitknecht drew my attention to and 
assisted with the J. B. Lang papers. Stephen Martin recovered Jung's letters to J. B. Lang, Paul Bishop, Wendy 
Doniger and Rachel McDermott responded to queries 

I would like to thank Ernst Falzeder for the reference in note 145 on p. 207, for transcribing Stockmayer’s 
letters to Jung, and for extensively correcting the translation of the introduction and notes in the German edition 

I would like to thank the Foundation of the Works of C. G. Jung and the Paul and Peter Fritz Literary Agency 
for permission to cite from Jung's unpublished manuscripts and correspondences, and Ximena Roelli de Angulo 
for permission to cite from Cary Baynes’s correspondence and diaries. 

Responsibility for the establishment of the text, the introduction, and the apparatus remain my own. Like the 
donkey on page 231 (note 29), I am glad finally to be able to lay down this load.

Liber Novus: 
The “Red Book” of C. G. Jung’ 


SONU SHAMDASANI 


Cc. G. JUNG is widely recognized as a major figure in modern Western 
thought, and his work continues to spark controversies. He played critical 
roles in the formation of modern psychology, psychotherapy, and psychiatry, 
and a large international profession of analytical psychologists work 
under his name. His work has had its widest impact, however, outside 
professional circles: Jung and Freud are the names that most people first 
think of in connection with psychology, and their ideas have been widely 
disseminated in the arts, the humanities, films, and popular culture. Jung 
is also widely regarded as one of the instigators of the New Age movement. 
However, it is startling to realize that the book that stands at the center 
of his oeuvre, on which he worked for over sixteen years, is only now 
being published. 

There can be few unpublished works that have already exerted such 
far-reaching effects upon twentieth-century social and intellectual history 
as Jung's Red Book, or Liber Novus (New Book). Nominated by Jung to 
contain the nucleus of his later works, it has long been recognized as 


the key to comprehending their genesis. Yet aside from a few tantalizing 


glimpses, it has remained unavailable for study. 





194 | LIBER Novus 


The Cultural Moment 


“The first few decades of the twentieth century saw a great deal 
of experimentation in literature, psychology, and the visual arts. 

Writers tried to throw off the limitations of representational 
conventions to explore and depict the full range of inner 
experience—dreams, visions, and fantasies. They experimented 
with new forms and utilized old forms in novel ways, From the 
automatic writing of the surrealists to the gothic fantasies of 
Gustav Meyrink, writers came into close proximity and collision 
with the researches of psychologists, who were engaged in similar 
explorations. Artists and writers collaborated to try out new 
forms of illustration and typography, new configurations of text 
and image, Psychologists sought to overcome the limitations of 
philosophical psychology, and they began to explore the same 
terrain as artists and writers, Clear demarcations among literature, 
art, and psychology had not yet been set; writers and artists 
borrowed from psychologists, and vice versa. A number of 
major psychologists, such as Alfred Binet and Charles Richet, 
‘wrote dramatic and fictional works, often under assumed names, 
whose themes mirrored those of their “scientific” works. Gustav 
Fechner, one of the founders of psychophysics and experimental 
psychology, wrote on the soul life of plants and of the earth 
as a blue angel? Meanwhile writers such as André Breton and 
Philippe Soupault assiduously read and utilized the works of 
psychical researchers and abnormal psychologists, such as 
Frederick Myers, Théodore Flournoy, and Pierre Janet. W. B. 
Yeats utilized spiritualistic automatic writing to compose a 
poetic psychocosmology in A Vision* On all sides, individuals 
‘were searching for new forms with which to depict the actualities 
of inner experience, in a quest for spiritual and cultural renewal. 

In Berlin, Hugo Ball noted: 


The world and society in 1913 looked like this: life is 
completely confined and shackled. A kind of economic 
fatalism prevails; each individual, whether he resists it 
‘or not, is assigned a specific role and with it his interests 
and his character. The church is regarded as a “redemption 
factory” of little importance, literature as a safety valve 
‘The most burning question day and night is: is there any- 
where a force that is strong enough to put an end to this 
state of affairs? And if not, how can one escape it? 


Within this cultural crisis Jung conceived of undertaking an 
extended process of self-experimentation, which resulted in Liber 
Novus, a work of psychology in a literary form, 

‘We stand today on the other side of adivide between psychology 
and literature. To consider Liber Novus today is to take up a work 
that could have emerged only before these separations had been 
firmly established. Its study helps us understand how the divide 
occurred, But first, we may ask, 


Who was C. G. Jung? 


Jung was born in Kesswil, on Lake Constance, in 1875. His family 
moved to Laufen by the Rhine Falls when he was six months 
old, He was the oldest child and had one sister. His father was a 
pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church. Toward the end of his life, 
Jung wrote a memoir entitled “From the Earliest Experiences of 
My Life,” which was subsequently included in Memories, Dreams, 
Reflections in a heavily edited form’ Jung narrated the significant 
events that led to his psychological vocation. The memoir, with 
its focus on significant childhood dreams, visions, and fantasies, 
can be viewed as an introduction to Liber Novus 

In the first dream, he found himself in 2 meadow with a 
stone-lined hole in the ground. Finding some stairs, he descended 
into it, and found himself in a chamber. Here there was a golden 
throne with what appeared to be a tree trunk of skin and flesh, 
with an eye on the top. He then heard his mother’s voice exclaim 
that this was the “man-eater.” He was unsure whether she meant 
that this figure actually devoured children or was identical with 
Christ. This profoundly affected his image of Christ. Years later, 
he realized that this figure was a penis and, later still, that it was 
in fact a ritual phallus, and that the setting was an underground 
temple. He came to sec this dream as an initiation “in the secrets 
of the earth.” 

In his childhood, Jung experienced a number of visual 
hallucinations. He also appears to have had the capacity to evoke 
images voluntarily. In a seminar in 1935, he recalled a portrait of 
his maternal grandmother which he would look at as a boy until 
he “saw” his grandfather descending the stairs 

‘One sunny day, when Jung was twelve, he was traversing the 
Miinsterplatz in Basel, admiring the sun shining on the newly 
restored glazed roof tiles of the cathedral, He then felt the 
approach of a terrible, sinful thought, which he pushed away. He 
was in a state of anguish for several days. Finally, after convincing 
himself that it was God who wanted him to think this thought, 
just as it had been God who had wanted Adam and Eve to sin, he 
let himself contemplate it, and saw God on his throne unleashing 
an almighty turd on the cathedral, shattering its new roof and 
smashing the cathedral, With this, Jung felt a sense of bliss and 
relief such as he had never experienced before. He felt that it was 
an experience of the “direct living God, who stands omnipotent 
and free above the Bible and Church.”* He felt alone before God, 
and that his real responsibility commenced then. He realized that 
it was precisely such a direct, immediate experience of the living 
God, who stands outside Church and Bible, that his father lacked. 

This sense of election led to a final disillusionment with the 
Church on the occasion of his First Communion, He had been 
led to believe that this would be a great experience. Instead, 
nothing, He concluded: “For me, it was an absence of God and no 
religion. Church was a place to which I no longer could go. There 
‘was no life there, but death.”

Jung's voracious reading started at this time, and he was 
particularly struck by Goethe’s Faust. He was struck by the fact 
that in Mephistopheles, Goethe took the figure of the devil 
seriously. In philosophy, he was impressed by Schopenhauer, 
who acknowledged the existence of evil and gave voice to the 
sufferings and miseries of the world. 

Jung also had a sense of living in two centuries, and felt a strong 
nostalgia for the eighteenth century. His sense of duality took the 
form of two alternating personalities, which he dubbed No. 1 
and 2, No. 1 was the Basel schoolboy, who read novels, and No. 2 
pursued religious reflections in solitude, in a state of communion 
with nature and the cosmos, He inhabited “God's world,” This 
personality fele most real, Personality No. 1 wanted tobe fice of the 
melancholy and isolation of personality No. 2. When personality 
No. 2 entered, it felt as if a long dead yet perpetually present 
spirit had entered the room, No. 2 had no definable character. He 
was connected to history, particularly with the Middle Ages. For 
NO. 2, NO. 1, with his failings and ineptitudes, was someone to 
be put up with. This interplay ran throughout Jung’s life. As he 
saw it, we are all like this—part of us lives in the present and the 
other part is connected to the centuries, 

As the time drew near for him to choose a career, the conflict, 
between the two personalities intensified. No. 1 wanted to pur- 
sue science, No, 2, the humanities. Jung then had two critical 
dreams, In the first, he was walking in a dark wood along the 
Rhine, He came upon a burial mound and began to dig, until 
he discovered the remains of prehistoric animals. This dream 
awakened his desire to learn more about nature, In the second 
dream, he was in a wood and there were watercourses, He 
found a circular pool surrounded by dense undergrowth. In the 
pool, he saw a beautiful creature, a large radiolarian, After these 
dreams, he settled for science. To solve the question of how to 
carn a living, he decided to study medicine. He then had another 
dream, He was in an unknown place, surrounded by fog, making 
slow headway against the wind. He was protecting a small light 
from going out. He saw a large black figure threateningly close. 
He awoke, and realized that the figure was the shadow cast from 
the light. He thought that in the dream, No. 1 was himself bearing. 
the light, and No, 2 followed like a shadow, He took this as a sign 
that he should go forward with No. 1, and not look back to the 
world of No. 2 

In his university days, the interplay between these personalities 
continued. In addition to his medical studies, Jung pursued an 
intensive program of extracurricular reading, in particular the 
works of Nietesche, Schopenhauer, Swedenborg," and writers 
on spiritualism. Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra made a great 
impression on him. He felt that his own personality No. 2 
corresponded to Zarathustra, and he feared that his personality 
NO. 2 was similarly morbid." He participated in a student debating 
society, the Zofingia society, and presented lectures on these 
subjects. Spiritualism particularly interested him, as the spiritualists 
appeared to be attempting to use scientific means to explore the 
supernatural, and prove the immortality of the soul 





INTRODUCTION | 195 


‘The latter half of the nineteenth century witnessed the 
emergence of modern spiritualism, which spread across Europe 
and America. Through spiritualism, the cultivation of trances— 
with the attendant phenomena of trance speech, glossolalia, 
automatic writing, and crystal vision—became widespread. The 
phenomena of spiritualism attracted the interest of leading 
scientists such as Crookes, Zollner, and Wallace. It also attracted 
the interest of psychologists, including Freud, Ferenczi, Bleuler, 
James, Myers, Janet, Bergson, Stanley Hall, Schrenck-Notzing, 
Moll, Dessois, Richet, and Flournoy. 

During his university days in Basel, Jung and his fellow students 
took part in séarices. In 1896, they engaged in a long series 
of sittings with his cousin Helene Preiswerk, who appeared to 
have mediumistic abilities. Jung found that during the trances, 
she would become different personalities, and that he could call 
up these personalities by suggestion. Dead relatives appeared, 
and she became completely transformed into these figures. She 
unfolded stories of her previous incarnations and articulated a 
mystical cosmology, represented in a mandala.” Her spiritualistic 
revelations carried on until she was caught attempting to fake 
physical apparitions, and the séances were discontinued. 

‘On reading Richard von Krafft-Ebing’s Text-Book of Psychiatry 
in 1899, Jung realized that his vocation lay in psychiatry, which 
represented a fusion of the interests of his two personalities. 
He underwent something like a conversion to a natural scientific 
framework. After his medical studies, he took up a post as an 
assistant physician at Burghdlzli hospital at the end of 1900 
The Burghélzli was a progressive university clinic, under the 
directorship of Eugen Bleuler. At the end of the nineteenth 
century, numerous figures attempted to found a new scientific 
psychology: It was held that by turning psychology into a science 
through introducing scientific methods, all prior forms of human 
understanding would be revolutionized. The new psychology was 
heralded as promising nothing less than the completion of the 
scientific revolution, Thanks to Bleuler, and his predecessor Auguste 
Forel, psychological research and hypnosis played prominent roles 
at the Burghilzli 

Jung’s medical dissertation focused on the psychogenesis of 
spiritualistic phenomena, in the form of an analysis of his séances 
with Helene Preiswerk:* While his inital interest in her case appeared 
to be in the possible veracity of her spiritualistic manifestations, in 
the interim, he had studied the works of Frederic Myers, William 
James, and, in particular, Théodore Flournoy. At the end of 1899, 
Flournoy had published a study of a medium, whom he called 
lane Smith, which became a best seller" What was novel about 
Flournoy’s study was that it approached her case purely from 
the psychological angle, as a means of illuminating the study of 
subliminal consciousness. A critical shift had taken place through 
the work of Flournoy, Frederick Myers, and William James. 
‘They argued that regardless of whether the alleged spiritualistic 
experiences were valid, such experiences enabled far-reaching 
insight into the constitution of the subliminal, and hence into 
human psychology as a whole, Through them, mediums became

In 1745, he had a vision of Christ. He then devoted his life ro relating what he 


sé heard and seen in Heaven and Hell and learned from the angels, and in interpreting 


the internal and symbolic meaning of the Bible. Swedenborg argued thatthe Bible had two levele of meaning: « phytical, literal level, and an inner, spcitual level 
‘These were linked by correspondences. He proclaimed the advent ofa new church” chat represented a new sptitul era. According to Swedenborg, from birth one 
acquired evils from ane’s parents which are lodged inthe natural man, who is diametrically opposed to the spiritual man. Man is destined for Heaven, and he cannot

important subjects of the new psychology. With this shift, the 
methods used by the mediums—such as automatic writing, 
trance speech, and crystal vision—were appropriated by the 
psychologists, and became prominent experimental research 
tools. In psychotherapy, Pierre Janet and Morton Prince used 
automatic writing and crystal gazing as methods for revealing 
hidden memories and subconscious fixed ideas. Automatic 
‘writing brought ro light subpersonalities, and enabled dialogues 
with them to be held."*For Janet and Prince, the goal of holding 
such practices was to reintegrate the personality 

Jung was so taken by Flournoy’s book that he offered to 
translate it into German, but Flournoy already had a translator, 
The impact of these studies is clear in Jung's dissertation, 
where he approaches the case purely from a psychological 
angle. Jung’s work was closely modeled on Flournoy’s From 
India to the Planet Mars, both in terms of subject matter and in 
its interpretation of the psychogenesis of Helene’ spiritualistic 
romances, Jung's dissertation also indicates the manner in 
which he was utilizing automatic writing as a method of 
psychological investigation. 

In 1902, he became engaged to Emma Rauschenbach, whom 
he married and with whom he had five children, Up till this 
point, Jung had kept a diary. In one of the last entries, dated 
May 1902, he wrote: “I am no longer alone with myself, and I can 
only artificially recall the scary and beautiful feeling of solitude 
This is the shadow side of the fortune of love."” For Jung, his 
marriage marked a move away from the solitude to which he had 
been accustomed. 

In his youth, Jung had often visited Basel's art museum and 
was particularly drawn to the works of Holbein and Bécklin, as 
well as to those of the Dutch painters." Toward the end of his 
studies, he was much occupied with painting for about a year. His 
paintings from this period were landscapes in a representational 
style, and show highly developed technical skills and fine technical 
proficiency In 1902/3, Jung left his post at the Burghdlzli and 
‘went to Paris to study with the leading French psychologist Pierre 
Janet, who was lecturing at the Collége de France, During his 
stay, he devoted much time to painting and visiting museums, 
going frequently to the Louvre. He paid particular attention to 
ancient art, Egyptian antiquities, the works of the Renaissance, 
Fra Angelico, Leonardo da Vinci, Rubens, and Frans Hals. He 
bought paintings and engravings and had paintings copied for 
the furnishing of his new home. He painted in both oil and 
watercolor. In January 1903, he went to London and visited its 
museums, paying particular attention to the Egyptian, Aztec, 
and Inca collections at the British Museum 

After his return, he took up a post that had become vacant 
at the Burghélzi and devoted his research to the analysis of 
linguistic associations, in collaboration with Franz. Riklin. 
With co-workers, they conducted an extensive series of 
experiments, which they subjected to statistical analyses. 
The conceptual basis of Jung's early work lay in the work 
of Flournoy and Janet, which he attempted to fuse with the

research methodology of Wilhelm Wundt and Emil Kraepelin. 
Jung and Riklin utilized the associations experiment, devised 
by Francis Galton and developed in psychology and psychiatry by 
‘Wundt, Kraepelin, and Gustav Aschaffenburg. The aim of the 
research project, instigated by Bleuler, was to provide a quick 
and reliable means for differential diagnosis. The Burghdlzli 
team failed to come up with this, but they were struck by the 
significance of disturbances of reaction and prolonged response 
times. Jung and Riklin argued that these disturbed reactions 
were due to the presence of emotionally stressed complexes, 
and used their experiments to develop a general psychology 
of complexes.” 

This work established Jung's reputation as one of the rising 
stars of psychiatry. In 1906, he applied his new theory of complexes 
to study the psychogenesis of dementia praecox (later called 
schizophrenia) and to demonstrate the intelligibility of delusional 
formations.” For Jung, along with a number of other psychiatrists 
and psychologists at this time, such as Janet and Adolf Meyer, 
insanity was not regarded as something completely set apart 
from sanity, but rather as lying on the extreme end of a spectrum. 
“Two years later, he argued that “If we feel our way into the human 
secrets of the sick person, the madness also reveals its system, and 
wwe recognize in the mental illness merely an exceptional reaction 
to emotional problems which are not strange to us.” 

Jung became increasingly disenchanted by the limitations of 
experimental and statistical methods in psychiatry and psychology. 
In the outpatient clinic at the Burghélzli, he presented hypnotic 
demonstrations. This led to his interest in therapeutics, and to the 
use of the clinical encounter as a method of research, Around 
1904, Bleuler introduced psychoanalysis into the Burghélzli, 
and entered into a correspondence with Freud, asking Freud 
for assistance in his analysis of his own dreams.* In 1906, Jung, 
entered into communication with Freud. This relationship 
has been much mythologized. A Freudocentric legend arose, 
which viewed Freud and psychoanalysis as the principal source 
for Jung’s work. This has led to the complete mislocation of 
his work in the intellectual history of the twentieth century. 
On numerous occasions, Jung protested. For instance, in an 
unpublished article written in the 1930s, “The schism in the 
Freudian school,” he wrote: “I in no way exclusively stem from 
Freud. I had my scientific attitude and the theory of complexes 
before I met Freud. The teachers that influenced me above all 
are Bleuler, Pierre Janet, and Théodore Flournoy.” Freud and 
Jung clearly came from quite different intellectual traditions, 
and were drawn together by shared interests in the psychogenesis 
of mental disorders and psychotherapy. Their intention was to 
form a scientific psychotherapy based on the new psychology: 
and, in turn, to ground psychology in the in-depth clinical 
investigation of individual lives 

With the lead of Bleuler and Jung, the Burghélzli became 
the center of the psychoanalytic movement. In 1908, the

‘was established, with Bleuler and Freud editors-in-chief and Jung 
as managing editor. Due to their advocacy, psychoanalysis gained 
ahearing in the German psychiatric world. In 1909, Jung received 
an honorary degree from Clark University for his association 
researches. The following year, an international psychoanalytic 
association was formed with Jung as the president. During the 
period of his collaboration with Freud, he was a principal architect 
of the psychoanalytic movement, For Jung, this was a period of 
intense institutional and political activity The movement was 
riven by dissent and acrimonious disagreements 


The Intoxication 


of Mythology 


In 1908, Jung bought some land by the shore of Lake Ziirich in 
Kiisnacht and had a house built, where he was to live for the rest 
of his life, In 1909, he resigned from the Burghilzli, to devote 
himself to his growing practice and his research interests. His 
retirement from the Burghdlzli coincided with a shift in his 
research interests to the study of mythology, folklore, and religion, 
and he assembled a vast private library of scholarly works. These 
researches culminated in Transformations and Symbols of the Libido, 
published in two installments in 1911 and 1912. This work can be 
seen to mark a return to Jung's intellectual roots and to his cultural 
and religious preoccupations. He found the mythological work 
exciting and intoxicating. In 1925 he recalled, “it seemed to me 
Iwas living in an insane asylum of my own making. I went about 
with all these fantastic figures: centaurs, nymphs, satyrs, gods and 
goddesses, a though they were patients and I was analyzing them. 
Tread a Greek or a Negro myth as if a lunatic were telling me 
his anamnesis.” The end of the nineteenth century had seen 
an explosion of scholarship in the newly founded disciplines 
of comparative religion and ethnopsychology. Primary texts 
were collected and translated for the first time and subjected 
to historical scholarship in collections such as Max Millle’s 
Sacred Books of the East. For many, these works represented an 
important relativization of the Christian worldview. 

In Transformations and Symbols ofthe Libido, Jung differentiated 
two kinds of thinking, Taking his cue from William James, among 
others, Jung contrasted directed thinking and fantasy thinking. 
The former was verbal and logical, while the latter was passive, 
associative, and imagistic. The former was exemplified by science 
and the latter by mythology. Jung claimed that the ancients lacked 
a capacity for directed thinking, which was a modern acquisition. 
Fantasy thinking took place when directed thinking ceased. 
Transformations and Symbols of the Libido was an extended study of 
fantasy thinking, and of the continued presence of mythological 
themes in the dreams and fantasies of contemporary individuals. 
Jung reiterated the anthropological equation of the prehistoric, 
the primitive, and the child, He held that the elucidation of 
current-day fantasy thinking in adults would concurrently shed 
light on the thought of children, savages, and prehistoric peoples. 

In this work, Jung synthesized nineteenth-century theories of 
memory, heredity, and the unconscious and posited a phylogenetic 
layer to the unconscious that was still present in everyone, consisting

of mythological images. For Jung, myths were symbols of the libido 
and they depicted its typical movements, He used the compara- 
tive method of anthropology to draw together a vast panoply of 
myths, and then subjected them to analytic interpretation. He 
later termed his use of the comparative method “amplification.” 
He claimed that there had to be typical myths, which corresponded 
to the ethnopsychological development of complexes. Following 
Jacob Burckhardt, Jung termed such typical myths “primordial 
images” (Urbilder). One particular myth was given a central role: 
that of the hero. For Jung, this represented the life of the individual, 
attempting to become independent and to free himself from 
the mother, He interpreted the incest motifas an attempt to return 
to the mother to be reborn. He was later to herald this work as 
marking the discovery of the collective unconscious, though the 
term itself came at a later date.” 

Ina series of articles from 1912, Jung’s friend and colleague 
‘Alphonse Maeder argued that dreams had a function other than 
that of wish fulfillment, which was a balancing or compensatory 
function, Dreams were attempts to solve the individual’s moral 
conflicts. As such, they did not merely point to the past, but 
also prepared the way for the future, Maeder was developing 
Flournoy’s views of the subconscious creative imagination. Jung 
wwas working along similar lines, and adopted Maeder’s positions. 
For Jung and Maeder, this alteration of the conception of the 
dream brought with it an alteration of all other phenomena 
associated with the unconscious 

Inhis preface to the 1952 revision of Transformations and Symbols 
af the Libido, Jung wrote that the work was written in 1911, when 
he was thirty-six: “The time is a critical one, for it marks the 
beginning of the second half of life, when a metanoia, a mental 
transformation, not infrequently occurs.” He added that he 
was conscious of the loss of his collaboration with Freud, and 
vwas indebted to the support of his wife. After completing the 
‘work, he realized the significance of what it meant to live without 
a myth, One without a myth “is like one uprooted, having no 
true link either with the past, or with the ancestral life which 
continues within him, or yet with contemporary human society.”” 
As he further describes it 


was driven to ask myself in all seriousness: ‘what is the myth 
you are living?” I found no answer to this question, and had to 
admit that I was not living with a myth, or even in a myth, but 
rather in an uncertain cloud of theoretical possibilities 
which I was beginning to regard with increasing distrust 

So in the most natural way, I took it upon myself to get 
to know “my” myth, and I regarded this as the task of 
tasks—for—so I told myself—how could I, when treating 
my patients, make due allowance for the personal factor, 
for my personal equation, which is yet so necessary for a 
knowledge of the other person, if I was unconscious of it?” 


The study of myth had revealed to Jung his mythlessness, He then 
undertook to get to know his myth, his “personal equation,” Thus 
wwe see that the self-experimentation which Jung undertook was in 
part a direct response to theoretical questions raised by his research, 
which had culminated in Transformations and Symbols of the Libido.

“My Most Difficult 


Experiment” 


In 1912, Jung had some significant dreams that he did not 
understand, He gave particular importance to two of these, 
which he felt showed the limitations of Freud’s conceptions of 
dreams. The first follows 


I was in a southern town, on a rising street with narrow half 
landings. It was twelve otlock midday—bright sunshine. 
An old Austrian customs guard or someone similar passes 
by me, lost in thought. Someone says, “that is one who cannot 
die. He died already 30-40 years ago, buthas not yet managed 
to decompose.” I was very surprised, Here a striking figure 
came, a knight of powerful build, clad in yellowish armor. 
He looks solid and inscrutable and nothing impresses him. 
On his back he carries a red Maltese cross. He has continued 
to exist from the 12th century and daily between 12 and 1 
o'clock midday he takes the same route. No one marvels at 
these two apparitions, but I was extremely surprised. 

hold back my interpretive sill. As regards the old Austrian, 
Freud occurred to me; as regards the knight, I myself 

Inside, a voice calls, “I is all empty and disgusting.” I 
must bear it* 


Jung found this dream oppressive and bewildering, and Freud 
vwas unable to interpret it. Around half a year later Jung had 
another dream: 


I dreamt at that time (it was shortly after Christmas 1912), 
that I was sitting with my children in a marvelous and richly 
furnished castle apartment—an open columned hall—we 
were sitting at a round table, whose top was a marvelous 
dark green stone. Suddenly a gull or a dove flew in and 
sprang lightly onto the table, I admonished the children 
to be quiet, so that they would not scare away the beautiful 
white bird, Suddenly this bird turned into a child of eight 
years, a small blond girl, and ran around playing with my 
children in the marvelous columned colonnades, ‘Then the 
child suddenly turned into the gull or dove. She said the 
following to me: “Only inthe fist hour ofthe night can I become 
human, while the male dove i busy with the twelve dead.” With these 
‘words the bird flew away and I awoke 


11 Black Book 2, pp. 25-26. 


In Black Book 2, Jung noted that it was this dream that made 
him decide to embark on a relationship with a woman he had 
met three years earlier (Toni Wolff).” In 1925, he remarked 
that this dream “was the beginning of a conviction that the 
unconscious did not consist of inert material only, but that there 
‘was something living down there.”* He added that he thought 
of the story of the Tabula smaragdine (emerald tablet), the twelve 
apostles, the signs of the Zodiac, and so on, but that he “could make 
nothing out of the dream except that there was a tremendous 
animation of the unconscious. I knew no technique of getting at the 
bottom of this activity; all I could do was just wait, keep on living, 
and watch the fantasies.”” These dreams led him to analyze his 
childhood memories, but this did not resolve anything He realized 
that he needed to recover the emotional tone of childhood. He 
recalled that as a child, he used to like to build houses and other 
structures, and he took this up again. 

While he was engaged in this self-analytic activity, he continued 
to develop his theoretical work. At the Munich Psycho-Analytical 
Congress in September 1913, he spoke on psychological types. 
He argued that there were two basic movements of the libido: 
extraversion, in which the subject's interest was oriented toward 
the outer world, and introversion, in which the subject’s interest 
was directed inward. Following from this, he posited two types 
of people, characterized by a predominance of one of these 
tendencies. The psychologies of Freud and Adler were examples 
of the fact that psychologies often took what was true of their 
type as generally valid, Hence what was required was a psychology 
that did justice to both of these types.” 

‘The following month, on a train journey to Schaffhausen, 
Jung experienced a waking vision of Europe being devastated 
by a catastrophic flood, which was repeated two weeks later, on 
the same journey:* Commenting on this experience in 1925, he 
remarked: “I could be taken as Switzerland fenced in by mountains 
and the submergence of the world could be the debris of my 
former relationships.” This led him to the following diagnosis, 
of his condition: “I thought to myself, ‘If this means anything, 
it means that I am hopelessly off” After this experience, Jung 
feared that he would go mad. He recalled that he first thought 
that the images of the vision indicated a revolution, but as he 
could not imagine this, he concluded that he was “menaced with 
a psychosis.” After this, he had a similar vision: 


In the following winter I was standing at the window one 
night and looked North, I saw a blood-red glows, like the

flicker of the sea seen from afar, stretched from East to West 
across the northern horizon. And at that time someone asked 
me what I thought about world events in the near future. I 
said that I had no thoughts, but saw blood, rivers of blood.* 


In the years directly preceding the outbreak of war, apocalyptic 
imagery was widespread in European arts and literature. For 
example, in 1912, Wassily Kandinsky wrote of a coming universal 
catastrophe. From 1912 to 1914, Ludwig Meidner painted a series 
of works known as the apocalyptic landscapes, with scenes of 
destroyed cities, corpses, and turmoil Prophecy was in the air. 
In 1899, the famous American medium Leonora Piper predicted 
that in the coming century there would be a tecrible war in different 
parts of the world that would cleanse the world and reveal the 
truths of spiritualism. In 1918, Arthur Conan Doyle, the spiritualist 
and author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, viewed this as having 
been prophetic.” 

In Jung’s account of the fantasy on the train in Liber Novus, the 
inner voice said that what the fantasy depicted would become 
completely real. Initially, he interpreted this subjectively and 
prospectively, that is, as depicting the imminent destruction of his 
‘world, His reaction to this experience was to undertake a psycho- 
logical investigation of himself In this epoch, self-experimentation 
was used in medicine and psychology. Introspection had been one 
of the main tools of psychological research. 

Jung came to realize that Transformations and Symbols of the 
Libido “could be taken as myself and that an analysis of it leads 
inevitably into an analysis of my own unconscious processes.” 
He had projected his material onto that of Miss Frank Miller, 
‘whom he had never met. Up to this point, Jung had been an active 
thinker and had been averse to fantasy: “as a form of thinking I 
held it to be altogether impure, a sort of incestuous intercourse, 
thoroughly immoral from an intellectual viewpoint.”® He now 
turned to analyze his fantasies, carefully noting everything, and 
had to overcome considerable resistance in doing this: “Permitting 
fantasy in myself had the same effect as would be produced on a 
man if he came into his workshop and found all the tools flying 
about doing things independently of his will In studying his 
fantasies, Jung realized that he was studying the myth-creating 
function of the mind, 

Jung picked up the brown notebook, which he had set aside 
in 1902, and began writing in it.* He noted his inner states in 
metaphors, such as being in a desert with an unbearably hot sun 
(Ghat is, consciousness). In the 1925 seminar, he recalled that 
it occurred to him that he could write down his reflections 
in a sequence. He was “writing autobiographical material, 
but not as an autobiography”® From the time of the Platonic

dialogues onward, the dialogical form has been a prominent 
genre in Western philosophy. In 387 CE, St. Augustine wrote 
his Soliloquies, which presented an extended dialogue between 
himself and “Reason,” who instructs him. They commenced with 
the following lines: 


When I had been pondering many different things to 
myself for a long time, and had for many days been seeking 
my own self and what my own good was, and what evil was 
to be avoided, there suddenly spoke to me—what was it? I 
myself or someone else, inside or outside me? (this isthe very 
thing I would love to know but don’t) 


While Jung was writing in Black Book 2, 


I said to myself, “What is this I am doing, it certainly is 
not science, what is it?” Then a voice said to me, “That is 
art” This made the strangest sort of impression upon me, 
because it was not in any sense my impression that what 
I was writing was art. Then I came to this, “Perhaps my 
unconscious is forming a personality that is not I, but which 
is insisting on coming through to expression.” I don’t know 
why exactly, but 1 knew to a certainty that the voice that 
had said my writing was art had come from a woman ... Well 
I said very emphatically to this voice that what I was doing 
‘was not art, and I felt a great resistance grow up within me. 
No voice came through, however, and I kept on writing 
This time I caught her and said, “No it is not,” and I felt as 
though an argument would ensue. 


He thought that this voice was “the soul in the primitive 
sense,” which he called the anima (the Latin word for soul). 
He stated that “In putting down all this material for analysis, I 
was in effect writing letters to my anima, that is part of myself 
with a different viewpoint from my own. I got remarks of a 
new character—I was in analysis with a ghost and a woman.” 
In retrospect, he recalled that this was the voice of a Dutch 
patient whom he knew from 1912 to 1918, who had persuaded 
a psychiatrist colleague that he was a misunderstood artist. The 
woman had thought that the unconscious was art, but Jung had 
maintained that it was nature." I have previously argued that the 
woman in question—the only Dutch woman in Jung'’s circle at 
this time—was Maria Moltzer, and that the psychiatrist in question 
was Jung's friend and colleague Franz Riklin, who increasingly 
forsook analysis for painting. In 1913, he became a student of 
Augusto Giacometti’s, the uncle of Alberto Giacometti, and an 
important early abstract painter in his own right”

‘The November entries in Black Book 2 depict Jung's sense of his, 
return to his soul. He recounted the dreams that led him to opt 
for his scientific career, and the recent dreams that had brought 
him back to his soul. As he recalled in 1925, this first period of 
writing came to an end in November: “Not knowing what would 
come next, I thought perhaps more introspection was needed 
T devised such a boring method by fantasizing that I was digging 
ahole, and by accepting this fantasy as perfectly real.”® The first 
such experiment took place on December 12, 1913 

‘As indicated, Jung had had extensive experience studying 
mediums in trance states, during which they were encouraged 
to produce waking fantasies and visual hallucinations, and had 
conducted experiments with automatic writing, Practices of 
visualization had also been used in various religious traditions. 
For example, in the fifth of the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius 
of Loyola, individuals are instructed on how to “see with the eyes 
of the imagination the length, breadth and depth of hell,” and to 
experience this with full sensory immediacy‘ Swedenborg also 
engaged in “spirit writing,” In his spiritual diary, one entry reads: 


26 JAN. 1748.—Spirits, if permitted, could possess those 
who speak with them so utterly, that they would be as 
though they were entizely in the world; and indeed, in a 
manner so manifest, that they could communicate their 
thoughts through their medium, and even by letters; 
for they have sometimes, and indeed often, directed my 
hand when writing, as though it were quite their own; so 
that they thought it was not I, but themselves writing * 


From 1909 onward in Vienna, the psychoanalyst Herbert Silberer 
conducted experiments on himself in hypnagogic states. 
Silberer attempted to allow images to appear. These images, 
he maintained, presented symbolic depictions of his previous 
train of thought. Silberer corresponded with Jung and sent him 
offprints of his articles. 

In 1912, Ludwig Staudenmaier (1865-1933), a professor 
of experimental chemistry, published a work entitled Magic 
as an Experimental Science, Staudenmaier had embarked on self- 
experimentations in 1901, commencing with automatic writing, 
A series of characters appeared, and he found that he no longer 
needed to write to conduct dialogues with them.* He also induced 
acoustic and visual hallucinations. The aim of his enterprise 
was to use his self-experimentation to provide a scientific 
explanation of magic. He argued that the key to understanding 
magic lay in the concepts of hallucinations and the “under 
consciousness” (Unterbewuftsei), and gave particular importance

to the role of personifications * Thus we sce that Jung's procedure 
closely resembled a number of historical and contemporary 
practices with which he was familiar 

From December 1913 onward, he carried on in the same 
procedure: deliberately evoking a fantasy in a waking state, and 
then entering into it as into a drama. These fantasies may be 
understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form, In 
reading his fantasies, the impact of Jung’s mythological studies is 
clear. Some of the figures and conceptions derive directly from 
his readings, and the form and style bear witness to his fascination 
with the world of myth and epic. In the Black Books, Jung wrote 
down his fantasies in dated entries, together with reflections on 
his state of mind and his difficulties in comprehending the fantasies. 
The Black Books are not diaries of events, and very few dreams are 
noted in them, Rather, they are the records of an experiment. In 
December 1913, he referred to the first of the black books as the 
“book of my most difficult experiment.” 

In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see 
‘what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example 
of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he 
wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does 
when taking mescalin.* 

Inn entry in his dream book on April 17, 1917, Jung noted: 
“since then, frequent exercises in the emptying of consciousness." 
His procedure was clearly intentional—while its aim was to 
allow psychic contents to appear spontaneously. He recalled 
that beneath the threshold of consciousness, everything was 
animated. At times, it was as if he heard something. At other 
times, he realized that he was whispering to himself” 

From November 1913 t0 the following July, he remained uncertain 
of the meaning and significance of his undertaking, and concerning 
the meaning of his fantasies, which continued to develop. During 
this time, Philemon, who would prove to be an important figure in 


subsequent fantasies, appeared in a dream. Jung recounted: 


There was a blue sky, like the sea, covered not by clouds 
bur by flat brown clods of earth, It looked as if the clods 
were breaking apart and the blue water of the sea were 
becoming visible between them, But the water was the blue 
sky. Suddenly there appeared from the right a winged being 
sailing across the sky. I saw that it was an old man with the 
horns of a bull. He held a bunch of four keys, one of which 
he clutched as if he were about to open a lock. He had the 
‘wings of the kingfisher with its characteristic colors, Since I 
did not understand this dream image, I painted it in order 
to impress it upon my memory."

While he was painting this image, he found a dead kingfisher 
(which is very rarely found in the vicinity of Ziirich) in his garden 
by the lake shore” 

‘The date of this dream is not clear. The figure of Philemon 
first appears in the Black Books on January 27, 1914, but with- 
out kingfisher wings. To Jung, Philemon represented superior 
insight, and was like a guru to him. He would converse with 
him in the garden. He recalled that Philemon evolved out of the 
figure of Elijah, who had previously appeared in his fantasies: 


Philemon was a pagan and brought with him an Egypto- 
Hellenic atmosphere with a Gnostic coloration... Itwas he 
who taught me psychic objectivity the reality of the psyche. 
Through the conversations with Philemon, the distinction 
‘was clarified between myself and the object of my thought 
Psychologically, Philemon represented superior insight” 


On April 20, Jung resigned as president of the International 
Psychoanalytical Association. On April 30, he resigned as alecturer 
in the medical faculty of the University of Ziirich, He recalled 
that he felt that he was in an exposed position at the university 
and fele that he had to find a new orientation, as it would otherwise 
be unfair to teach students In June and July, he had a thrice- 
repeated dream of being in a foreign land and having to return 
home quickly by ship, followed by the descent of an icy cold 

On July 10, the Ziirich Psychoanalytical Society voted by 
15 t0 1 to leave the International Psychoanalytic Association. 
In the minutes, the reason given for the secession was that 
Freud had established an orthodoxy that impeded free and 
independent research.” The group was renamed the Association 
for Analytical Psychology. Jung was actively involved in this 
association, which met fortnightly, He also maintained a busy 
therapeutic practice. Between 1913 and 1914, he had between 
one and nine consultations per day, five days a week, with an 
average of between five and seven.” 

The minutes of the Association for Analytical Psychology 
offer no indications of the process that Jung was going through. 
He does not refer to his fantasies, and continues to discuss 
theoretical issues in psychology. The same holds true in his 
surviving correspondences during this period Each year, he 
continued his military service duties” Thus he maintained his 
professional activities and familial responsibilities during the day, 
and dedicated his evenings to his self-explorations.® Indications 
are that this partitioning of activities continued during the next 
few years, Jung recalled that during this period his family and 
profession “always remained a joyful reality and a guarantee that 
T was normal and really existed.”" 

The question of the different ways of interpreting such 
fantasies was the subject of a talk that he presented on July 24 
before the Psycho-Medical Society in London, “On psychological

understanding.” Here, he contrasted Freud's analytic-reductive 
method, based on causality, with the constructive method of the 
Ziirich school, The shortcoming of the former was that through 
tracing things back to antecedent elements, it dealt with only half 
of the picture, and failed to grasp the living meaning of phenomena. 

Someone who attempted to understand Goethe's Faust in such a 
‘manner would be like someone who tried to understand a Gothic 
cathedral under its mineralogical aspect. The living meaning 
“only lives when we experience it in and through ourselves.” 
Inasmuch as life was essentially new, it could not be understood 
merely retrospectively. Hence the constructive standpoint asked, 
“how, out of this present psyche, a bridge can be built into its own. 
future.” This paper implicitly presents Jung’s rationale for not 
embarking on a causal and retrospective analysis of his fantasies, 
and serves as a caution to others who may be tempted to do so 

Presented as a critique and reformulation of psychoanalysis, Jung’s 
new mode of interpretation links back to the symbolic method of 
Swedenborg's spiritual hermeneutics. 

On July 28, Jung gave a talk on “The importance of the 
unconscious in psychopathology” at a meeting of the British 
Medical Association in Aberdeen.* He argued that in cases of 
neurosis and psychosis, the unconscious attempted to compensate 
the one-sided conscious attitude. The unbalanced individual 
defends himself against this, and the opposites become more 
polarized. The corrective impulses that present themselves in the 
language of the unconscious should be the beginning of a healing 
process, but the form in which they break through makes them 





unacceptable to consciousness. 
‘A month earlier, on June 28, Archduke Franz. Ferdinand, 
the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, was assassinated by 
Gavrilo Princip, a nineteen-year-old Serb student. On August I, 
war broke out. In 1925 Jung recalled, “I had the feeling that I was 
an over-compensated psychosis, and from this feeling I was not 
released till August 1" 1914." Years later, he said to Mircea Eliade: 


As a psychiatrist I became worried, wondering if I was 
not on the way to “doing a schizophrenia,” as we said in 
the language of those days ... I was just preparing a lecture 
on schizophrenia to be delivered at a congress in Aberdeen, 
and I kept saying to myself: I'l be speaking of myself! Very 
likely I'll go mad after reading out this paper.” The congress 
was to take place in July 1914—exactly the same period 
when I saw myself in my three dreams voyaging on the 
Southern seas. On July 31", immediately after my lecture, 
I learned from the newspapers that war had broken out. 
Finally I understood. And when I disembarked in Holland 
on the next day, nobody was happier than I. Now I was 
sure that no schizophrenia was threatening me. I under- 
stood that my dreams and my visions came to me from the 
subsoil of the collective unconscious. What remained for

me to do now was to deepen and validate this discovery 
‘And this is what I have been trying to do for forty years.” 


Ac this moment, Jung considered that his fantasy had depicted 
not what would happen to kim, but to Europe. In other words, 
that it was a precognition of a collective event, what he would 
later call a “big” dream." After this realization, he attempted to 
see whether and to what extent this was true of the other fantasies 
that he experienced, and to understand the meaning of this 
correspondence between private fantasies and public events, 
“This effort makes up much of the subject matter of Liber Novus. 
In Scrutinies, he wrote that the outbreak of the war had enabled 
him to understand much of what he had previously experienced, 
and had given him the courage to write the earlier part of Liber 
Novus” Thus he took the outbreak of the war as showing him 
that his fear of going mad was misplaced. It is no exaggeration 
to say that had war not been declared, Liber Novus would in 
all likelihood not have been compiled. In 1955/56, while discussing 
active imagination, Jung commented that “the reason why 
the involvement looks very much like a psychosis is that the 
patient is integrating the same fantasy-material to which the 
insane person falls victim because he cannot integrate it but is 
swallowed up by it." 

It is important to note that there are around twelve separate 
fantasies that Jung may have regarded as precognitive:

Liber Novus 


Jung now commenced writing the draft of Liber Novus, He 
faithfully transcribed most of the fantasies from the Black Books, 
and to each of these added a section explaining the significance of 
cach episode, combined with a lyrical elaboration, Word-by-word 
comparison indicates that the fantasies were faithfully reproduced, 
with only minor editing and division into chapters. Thus the 
sequence of the fantasies in Liber Novus nearly always exactly 
corresponds to the Black Books. When it is indicated that a 
particular fantasy happened “on the next night,” etc,, this is 
always accurate, and not a stylistic device. The language and 
content of the material were not altered. Jung maintained 
a “fidelity to the event,” and what he was writing was not to 
be mistaken for a fiction. The draft begins with the address to “My 
friends,” and this phrase occurs frequently. The main difference 
between the Black Books and Liber Novus is that the former were 
written for Jung's personal use, and can be considered the records 
of an experiment, while the latter is addressed to a public and 
presented in a form to be read by others. 

In November 1914, Jung closely studied Nietzsche's Thus Spoke 
Zarathustra, which he had first read in his youth. He later recalled, 
“then suddenly the spirit seized me and carried me to a desert 
country in which I read Zarathustra.”® It strongly shaped the 
structure and style of Liber Novus. Like Nietzsche in Zarathustra, 
Jung divided the material into a series of books comprised of 
short chapters. But whereas Zarathustra proclaimed the death of 
God, Liber Novus depicts the rebirth of God in the soul. There are 
also indications that he read Dante’s Commedia at this time, which 
also informs the structure of the work” Liber Novus depicts Jung’ 
descent into Hell. But whereas Dante could utilize an established 
cosmology, Liter Novus is an attempt to shape an individual 
cosmology. The role of Philemon in Jung's work has analogies to 
that of Zarathustra in Nietesche’s work and Virgil in Dante's. 

In the Draft, about 50 percent of the material is drawn directly 
from the Black Books. There are about thirty-five new sections of 
commentary. In these sections, he attempted to derive general 
psychological principles from the fantasies, and to understand to 
‘what extent the events portrayed in the fantasies presented, in a 
symbolic form, developments that were to occur in the world. In 
1913, Jung had introduced a distinction between interpretation 
on the objective level in which dream objects were treated as 
representations of real objects, and interpretation on the subjective 
level in which every element concerns the dreamers themselves. 
‘As well as interpreting his fantasies on the subjective level, one 
could characterize his procedure here as an attempt to interpret 
his fantasies on the “collective” level. He does not try to interpret 
his fantasies reductively, but sees them as depicting the functioning,

of general psychological principles in him (such as the relation 
of introversion to extraversion, thinking and pleasure, ete), and 
as depicting literal or symbolic events that are going to happen, 
Thus the second layer of the Draft represents the first major 
and extended attempt to develop and apply his new constructive 
method, The second layer is itself a hermeneutic experiment. 
In a critical sense, Liber Nosus does not require supplemental 
interpretation, for it contains its own interpretation. 

In writing the Draft, Jung did not add scholarly references, 
though unreferenced citations and allusions to works of philosophy, 
religion, and literature abound. He had self-consciously chosen to 
leave scholarship to one side. Yet the fantasies and the reflections 
on them in the Red Book are those of a scholar and, indeed, much 
of the self-experimentation and the composition of Liber Novus 
took place in his library: It is quite possible that he might have 
added references if he had decided to publish the work 

After completing the handwritten Draft, Jung had it typed, 
and edited it. On one manuscript, he made alterations by 
hand (I refer to this manuscript as the Corrected Draff). Judging 
from the annotations, it appears that he gave it to someone (the 
hhandvwriting is not that of Emma Jung, Toni Wolff, or Maria Moltzet) 
to read, who then commented on Jung’ editing, indicating that 
some sections which he had intended to cut should be retained.” 
The first section of the work—untitled, but effectively Léber 
Primus—was composed on parchment. Jung then commissioned a 
large folio volume of over 600 pages, bound in red leather, from 
the bookbinders, Emil Stier, The spine bears the title, Liber Novus. 
He then inserted the parchment pages into the folio volume, which 
continues with Liber Secundus. The work is organized like a medieval 
illuminated manuscript, with caligraphic writing, headed by a table 
of abbreviations. Jung titled the first book “The Way of What is to 
Come,” and placed beneath this some citations from the book of 
Isaiah and from the gospel according to John. Thus it was presented 
as a prophetic work. 

In the Drafi, Jung had divided the material into chapters 
In the course of the transcription into the red leather folio, he 
altered some of the titles to the chapters, added others, and edied 
the material once again. The cuts and alterations were predominantly 
to the second layer of interpretation and elaboration, and not to 
the fantasy material itself, and mainly consisted in shortening the 
text. Itis this second layer that Jung continually reworked, In the 
transcription of the text in this edition, this second layer has been 
indicated, so that the chronology and composition are visible, As 
Jung's comments in the second layer sometimes implicitly refer 
forward to fantasies that are found later in the text, it is also 
helpful to read the fantasies straight through in chronological 
sequence, followed by a continuous reading of the second layer. 

Jung then illustrated the text with some paintings, historiated 
initials, ornamental borders, and margins. Initially, the paintings 
refer directly to the text, At a later point, the paintings become

more symbolic. They are active imaginations in their own right. 
The combination of text and image recalls the illuminated works 
of William Blake, whose work Jung had some familiarity with.” 
‘A preparatory draft of one of the images in Liber Novus has 
survived, which indicates that they were carefully composed, 
starting from pencil sketches that were then elaborated,” The 
composition of the other images likely followed a similar proceduce. 
From the paintings of Jung’s which have survived, it is striking 
that they make an abrupt leap from the representational landscapes 
of 1902/3 to the abstract and semifigurative from 1915 onward. 


Art and the Ziirich School 


Jung's library today contains few books on modern art, though 
some books were probably dispersed over the years. He possessed 
a catalogue of the graphic works of Odilon Redon, as well as a 
study of him." He likely encountered Redon’s work when he was 
in Paris, Strong echoes of the symbolist movement appear in the 
paintings in Liber Novus. 

In October of 1910, Jung went on a bicycle tour of northern 
Iealy, together with his colleague Hans Schmid. They visited 
Ravenna, and the frescos and mosaics there made a deep impression 
on him, These works seemed to have had an impact on his paintings: 
the use of strong colors, mosaic-like forms, and two-dimensional 
figures without the use of perspective” 

In 1913 when he was in New York, he likely attended the 
Armory Show, which was the first major international exhibition 
of modern art in America (the show ran to March 15, and Jung 
left for New York on March 4). He referred to Marcel Duchamp’s 
painting Nude descending the stairs in his 1925 seminar, which had 
caused a furor there." Here, he also referred to having studied 
the course of Picasso's paintings. Given the lack of evidence of 
extended study, Jung’ knowledge of modern art probably derived 
more immediately from direct acquaintance. 

During the First World War, there were contacts between 
the members of the Ziirich school and artists. Both were part 
of avant-garde movements and intersecting social cicles™ In 1913, 
Erika Schlegel came to Jung for analysis, She and her husband, 
Eugen Schlegel, had been friendly with Toni Wolff Erika Schlegel 
was Sophie Taeuber’s sister, and became the librarian of the 
Psychological Club. Members of the Psychological Club were 
invited to some of the Dada events. At the celebration of the 
opening of the Gallery Dada on March 29, 1917, Hugo Ball notes 
members of the Club in the audience." The program that evening 
included abstract dances by Sophie Taeuber and poems by 
Hugo Ball, Hans Arp, and Tristan Taara. Sophie Taeuber, who 
had studied with Laban, arranged a dance class for members 
of the Club together with Arp. A masked ball was also held and she 
designed the costumes" In 1918, she presented a marionette play, 
King Deer, in Zirich, Ie was set in the woods by the Burghilal.

Freud Analytikus, opposed by Dr. Oedipus Complex, is transformed 
into a parrot by the Ur-Libido, parodically taking up themes from 
Jung's Transformations and Symbols ofthe Libido and his conflict with 
Freud. However, relations between Jung's circle and some of the 
Dadaists became more strained. In May 1917, Emmy Hennings 
wrote to Hugo Ball that the “psycho- Club” had now gone away." In 
1918, Jung criticized the Dada movement in a Swiss review, which 
did not escape the attention of the Dadaists."* The critical element 
that separated Jung's pictorial work from that of the Dadaists was his 
overriding emphasis on meaning and signification 

Jung's self-explorations and creative experiments did not 
occur in a vacuum. During this period, there was great interest in art 
and painting within his circle. Alphonse Maeder wrote a monograph 
on Ferdinand Hodler” and had a friendly correspondence 
with him, Around 1916, Macder had a series of visions or 
waking fantasies, which he published pseudonymously. When he 
told Jung of these events, Jung replied, "What, you too?”"” Hans 
Schmid also wrote and painted his fantasies in something akin to 
Liber Novus. Moltzer was keen to increase the artistic activities 
of the Ziirich school, She felt that more artists were needed 
in their circle and considered Riklin as a model. J. B. Lang, 
who was analyzed by Riklin, began to paint symbolic paintings 
Moltzer had a book that she called her Bible, in which she put 
pictures with writings. She recommended that her patient 
Fanny Bowditch Katz do the same thing," 

In 1919, Rikdin exhibited some of his paintings as part of the 
“New Life” at the Kunsthaus in Ziirich, described as a group of 
Swiss Expressionists, alongside Hans Arp, Sophie Tacuber, 
Francis Picabia, and Augusto Giacometti."* With his personal 
connections, Jung could easily have exhibited some of his works 
in such a setting, had he so liked. Thus his refusal to consider 
his works as art occurs in a context where there were quite real 
possibilities for him to have taken this route. 

On some occasions, Jung discussed art with Erika Schlegel. 
She noted the following conversation: 


Iwore my pearl medallion (the pearl embroidery that Sophie 
had made for me) at Jung's yesterday. He liked it very much, 
and itprompted him to talkanimatedly aboutart—for almost 
an hour. He discussed Riklin, one of Augusto Giacometti’s 
students, and observed that while his smaller works had a 
certain aesthetic value, his larger ones simply dissolved. 
Indeed, he vanished wholly in his art, rendering him utterly 
intangible. His work was like a wall over which water rippled. 
He could therefore not analyze, as this required one to be 
pointed and sharp-edged, ikea knife, He had fallen into art 


in a manner of speaking, But art and science were no more 
than the servants of the creative spirit, which is what must 
be served, 

As regards my own work, it was also a matter of making 
out whether it was really art. Fairy tales and pictures had a 
religious meaning at bottom. I, too, know that somehow 
and sometime it must reach people.”” 


For Jung, Franz. Riklin appears to have been something like a 
doppelganger, whose fate he was keen to avoid. This statement 
also indicates Jung’srelativization of the status of art and science 
to which he had come through his self-experimentation. 

“Thus, the making of Liber Novus was by no means a peculiar 
and idiosyncratic activity, nor the product of a psychosis. Rather, 
it indicates the close intersections between psychological and 
artistic experimentation with which many individuals were 
engaged at this time. 


The Collective Experiment 


In 1915, Jung held a lengthy correspondence with his colleague 
Hans Schmid on the question of the understanding of psycho- 
logical types. This correspondence gives no direct signs of Jung's 
self-experimentation, and indicates that theories he developed 
during this period did not stem solely from his active imaginations, 
but also in part consisted of conventional psychological theorizing." 
(On March , 1915, Jung wrote to Smith Ely Jeliffe: 


am still with the army in a little town where I have plenty 
of practical work and horseback riding . .. Until I had to 
join the army I lived quietly and devoted my time to my 
patients and to my work. I was especially working about 
the two types of psychology and about the synthesis of 
unconscious tendencies." 


During his self-explorations, he experienced states of turmoil, 
He recalled that he experienced great fear, and sometimes had to 
hold the table to keep himself together," and “I was frequently 
so wrought up that I had to eliminate the emotions through yoga 
practices. But since it was my purpose to learn what was going on 
within myself, I would do them only until I had calmed myself 
and could take up again the work with the unconscious.”"" 

He recalled that Toni Wolff had become drawn into the process 
in which he was involved, and was experiencing a similar stream 
of images. Jung found that he could discuss his experiences with 
her, but she was disorientated and in the same mess."* Likewise, his

wife was unable to help him in this regard. Consequently he noted, 
“that I was able to endure at all was a case of brute force."” 

The Psychological Club had been founded at the beginning 
of 1916, through a gift of 360,000 Swiss francs from Edith 
Rockefeller McCormick, who had come to Ziirich to be analyzed 
by Jung in 1913, At its inception, it had approximately sixty 
members. For Jung, the aim of the Club was to study the relation 
of individuals to the group, and to provide a naturalistic setting for 
psychological observation to overcome the limitations of one-to- 
one analysis, as well as to provide a venue where patients could 
learn to adapt to social situations. At the same time, a professional 
body of analysts continued to meet together as the Association 
for Analytical Psychology" Jung participated fully in both of 
these organizations. 

Jung's self-experimentation also heralded a change in his analytic 
work, He encouraged his patients to embark upon similar processes 
of self experimentation, Patients were instructed on how to conduct 
active imagination, to hold inner dialogues, and to paint their 
fantasies, He took his own experiences as paradigmatic. In the 
1925 seminar, he noted: “I drew all my empirical material from my 
patients, but the solution of the problem I drew from the inside, 
from my observations of the unconscious processes.”* 

Tina Keller, who was in analysis with Jung from 1912, recalls 
that Jung “often spoke of himself and his own experiences” 


In those early days, when one arrived for the analytic 
hour, the so-called “red book” often stood open on an 
easel. In it Dr. Jung had been painting or had just finished a 
picture, Sometimes he would show me what he had done and 
comment upon it. The careful and precise work he put into 
these pictures and into the illuminated text that accompanied 
them were a testimony to the importance of this undertaking 
The master thus demonstrated to the student that psychic 
development is worth time and effort 


In her analyses with Jung and Toni Wolff, Keller conducted 
active imaginations and also painted. Far from being a solitary 
endeavor, Jung's confrontation with the unconscious was a collective 
one, in which he took his patients along with him. Those around 
Jung formed an avant-garde group engaged in a social experiment 
that they hoped would transform their lives and the lives of 
those around them. 


The Return of the Dead 


Amid the unprecedented carnage of the war, the theme of the 
return of the dead was widespread, such as in Abel Gance’s film 
Faccuse® The death toll also led to a revival of interest in spiritual- 
ism. After nearly a year, Jung began to write again in the Black Books 
in 1915, with a further series of fantasies. He had already completed 
the handwritten draft of Liber Primus and Liber Secundus™ At the 
beginning of 1916, Jung experienced a striking series of parapsy- 
chological events in his house, In 1923, he narrated this event to 
Cary de Angulo (later Baynes). She recorded it as follows: 


119 Memories, p. 201 


INTRODUCTION | 205 


‘One night your boy began to rave in his sleep and throw 
himself about saying he couldn't wake up. Finally your 
wife had to call you to get him quiet & this you could 
only do by cold cloths on him—finally he settled down and 
went on sleeping Next morning he woke up remembering 
nothing, but seemed utterly exhausted, so you told him 
not to go to school, he didn’t ask why but seemed to take 
it for granted, But quite unexpectedly he asked for paper 
and colored pencils and set to work to make the following 
picture—a man was angling for fishes with hook and 
line in the middle of the picture. On the left was the Devil 
saying something to the man, and your son wrote down 
what he said. Tt was that he had come for the fisherman 
because he was catching his fishes, but on the right was an 
angel who said, “No you can’t take this man, he is taking 
only bad fishes and none of the good ones.” Then after 
your son had made that picture he was quite content. The 
same night, two of your daughters thought that they had 
seen spooks in their rooms. The next day you wrote out 
the “Sermons to the Dead,” and you knew after that noth- 
ing more would disturb your family, and nothing did. Of 
course I knew you were the fisherman in your son’s pic~ 
ture, and you told me so, but the boy didn’t know it." 


In Memories, Jung recounted what followed: 


‘Around five otlock in the afternoon on Sunday the front 
doorbell began ringing frantically... Everyone immediately 
looked to see who was there, but there was no one in sight. 
I was sitting near the doorbell, and not heard it but saw 
it moving We all simply stared at one another. The atmosphere 
‘was thick, believe me! Then I knew something had to happen. 
The whole house was as if there was a crowd present, 
crammed full of spivits. They were packed deep right up 
to the door and the air was so thick it was scarcely possible 
to breathe, As for myself, I was all aquiver with the question 
“For God's sake, what in the world is this?” Then they cried 
out in chorus, “We have come back from Jerusalem where 
‘we found not what we sought.” That is the beginning of the 
Septem Sermones. 

‘Then it began to flow out of me, and in the course of 
three evenings the thing was written. As soon as I took 
up the pen, the whole ghastly assemblage evaporated. The 
room quieted and the atmosphere cleared. The haunting 
was over."* 


The dead had appeared in a fantasy on January 17, 1914, and had 
said that they were about to go to Jerusalem to pray at the holiest 
graves.” Their trip had evidently not been successful, The Septem 
Sermones ad Mortues isa culmination of the fantasies of this period. 
It is a psychological cosmology cast in the form of a gnostic 
creation myth. In Jung’s fantasies, a new God had been born in 
his soul, the God who is the son of the frogs, Abraxas. Jung 
understood this symbolically. He saw this figure as representing.

the uniting of the Christian God with Satan, and hence as depicting 
a transformation of the Western God-image. Not until 1952 in 
‘Answer to Job did Jung elaborate on this theme in public. 

Jung had studied the literature on Gnosticism in the course 
of his preparatory reading for Transformations and Symbols of the 
Libido, In January and October 1915, while on military service, 
he studied the works of the Gnostics, After writing the Septem 
Sermones in. the Black Books, Jung recopied it in a calligraphic 
script into a separate book, slightly rearranging the sequence 
He added the following inscription under the title: “The seven 
instructions of the dead, Written by Basilides in Alexandria, 
the city where the East touches the West.”™* He then had this 
privately printed, adding to the inscription: “Translated from 
the Greek original into German.” This legend indicates the 
stylistic effects on Jung of late-nineteenth-century classical 
scholarship. He recalled that he wrote it on the occasion of 
the founding of the Psychological Club, and regarded it as a 
gift to Edith Rockefeller McCormick for founding the Club. 
He gave copies to friends and confidants. Presenting a copy to 
Alphonse Maeder, he wrote 


1 could not presume to put my name to it, but chose instead 
the name of one of those great minds of the early Christian era 
which Christianity obliterated. It fll quite unexpectedly into 
my lap like a ripe fruit at a time of great stress and has kindled 
a light of hope and comfort for me in my bad hours.” 


On January 16, 1916, Jung drew a mandala in the Black Books 
(Gee Appendix A). This was the first sketch of the “Systema 
Munditotius.” He then proceeded to paint this, On the back of 
it, he wrote in English: “This is the first mandala I constructed 
in the year 1916, wholly unconscious of what it meant.” The 
fantasies in the Black Books continued. The Systema Munditotius is 
a pictorial cosmology of the Sermones 

Between June 11 and October 2, 1917, Jung was on military 
service in Chateau d’Oex, as commander of the English prisoners 
of war. Around August, he wrote to Smith Ely Jeliffe that his 
military service had taken him completely away from his work 
and that, on his return, he hoped to finish a long paper about the 
types. He concluded the letter by writing: “With us everything 
is unchanged and quiet. Everything else is swallowed by the war. 
The psychosis is still increasing, going on and on.” 

‘Ac this time, he felt that he was still in a state of chaos and 
that it only began to clear toward the end of the war: From the 
beginning of August to the end of September, he drew a series 
of twenty-seven mandalas in pencil in his army notebook, which 
he preserved.” At first, he did not understand these mandalas, 
but fele that they were very significant, From August 20, he drew 
a mandala on most days. This gave him the feeling that he had 
taken a photograph of each day and he observed how these manda- 


las changed, He recalled that he received a letter from “this Dutch 
‘woman that got on my nerves terribly.”™ In this letter, this woman, 
that is, Moltzer, argued that “the fantasies stemming from the 
unconscious possessed artistic worth and should be considered as 
art." Jung found this troubling because it was not stupid, and, 
moreover, modern painters were attempting to make art out of 
the unconscious. This awoke a doubt in him whether his fantasies 
were really spontaneous and natural. On the next day, he drew a 
mandala, and a piece of it was broken off, leaving the symmetry: 


Only now did I gradually come to what the mandala really 
is: “Formation, transformation, the eternal mind’s eternal 
recreation.” And that is the self, the wholeness of the per- 
sonality, which, when everything is well, is harmonious, but 
which can bear no self deception. My mandala images were 
cryptogeams on the state of my self, which were delivered 
to me each day." 


“The mandala in question appears to be the mandala of August 6, 
19172" The second line is from Goethe's Faust, Mephistopheles is 
addressing Faust, giving him directions to the realm of the Mothers: 


MEPHISTOPHELES 
A glowing tripod will finally show you 

that you are in the deepest, most deepest ground. 
By its light you will see the Mothers: 

the one sits, others stand and walk, 

as it may chance. Formation, transformation 

the eternal mind’s eternal recreation. 

Covered in images of all creatures, 

they do not see you, since they only see shades. 
Then hold your heart, since the danger is great, 
and go straight to that tripod, 

touch it with the key!” 


The letter in question has not come to light. However, in a 
subsequent unpublished letter from November 21, 1918, while at 
Chateau d’Oex, Jung wrote that “M. Moltzer has again disturbed 
me with letters.”®” He reproduced the mandalas in Liber Novus. He 
noted that it was during this period that a living idea of the self 
first came to him: “The self, I thought, was like the monad which 
Lam, and which is my world. The mandala represents this monad, 
and corresponds to the microcosmie nature of the soul.” Ar this 
point, he did not know where this process was leading, but he 
began to grasp that the mandala represented the goal of the pro- 
cess: “Only when I began to paint the mandalas did I see that all 
the paths T took, all the steps I made, all led back to the one point, 

that is, to the center. The mandala became the expression of all 
paths.” In the 1920s, Jung's understanding of the significance 
of the mandala deepened.

‘The Draft had contained fantasies from October 1913 to 
February 1914. In the winter of 1917, Jung wrote a fresh manuscript 
called Scrutinies, which began where he had left off. In this, he 
transcribed fantasies from April 1913 until June 1916, As in the 
first two books of Liber Novus, Jung interspersed the fantasies with 
interpretive commentaries."* He included the Sermones in this 
material, and now added Philemon’s commentaries on each 
sermon, In these, Philemon stressed the compensatory nature 
of his teaching: he deliberately stressed precisely those conceptions 
that the dead lacked, Scrutinies effectively forms Liter Tertius of 
Liber Novus. The complete sequence of the text would thus be: 


Liber Primus: The Way of What Is to Come 
Liber Secundus: The Images of the Erving 
Liber Tertius: Scrutinies 


During this period, Jung continued transcribing the Draft 
into the calligraphic volume and adding paintings. The fantasies 
in the Black Books became more intermittent. He portrayed his 
realization of the significance of the self, which took place in the 
autumn of 1917, in Serutinies This contains Jung’ vision of the 
reborn God, culminating in the portrayal of Abraxas. He realized 
that much of what was given to him in the earlier part of the book 
(that is, Liber Primus and Liber Secundus) was actually given to him 
by Philemon. He realized that there was a prophetic wise old man 
in him, to whom he was not identical. This represented a critical 
disidentification. On January 17, 1918, Jung wrote to J. B. Lang: 





“The work on the unconscious has to happen first and foremost 
for us ourselves, Our patients profit from it indirectly. The 
danger consists in the prophet’s delusion which often is the 
result of dealing with the unconscious. It is the devil who 
says: Disdain all reason and science, mankind's highest powers. 
That is never appropriate even though we are forced to 
acknowledge [the existence of] the irrational."* 


Jung's critical task in “working over” his fantasies was to 
differentiate the voices and characters. For example, in the Black 
Books, it is Jung’s “1” who speaks the Sermones to the dead. In 
Scrutines, it is not Jung's “1” but Philemon who speaks them. In 
the Black Books, the main figure with whom Jung has dialogues is 
his soul. In some sections of Liber Novus, this is changed to the 
serpent and the bird. In one conversation in January 1916, his 
soul explained to him that when the Above and Below are not 
united, she falls into three parts—a serpent, the human soul, 
and the bird or heavenly soul, which visits the Gods. Thus Jung's 
revision here can be seen to reflect his understanding of the 
tripartite nature of his soul.“ 

During this period, Jung continued to work over his material, 
and there is some indication that he discussed it with his colleagues 
In March 1918 he wrote to J.B. Lang, who had sent him some of 
his own fantasies: 


I would not want to say anything more than telling you 
to continue with this approach because, as you have observed 
correctly yourself, it is very important that we experience 
the contents of the unconscious before we form any 
opinions about it. I very much agree with you that we 


INTRODUCTION | 207 


have to grapple with the knowledge content of gnosis and 
neo-Platonism, since these are the systems that contain the 
materials which are suited to form the basis of a theory of 
the unconscious spirit. I have already been working on this 
myself for along time, and also have had ample opportunity 
to compare my experiences at least partially with those of 
others. That's why I was very pleased to hear pretty much 
the same views from you, I am glad that you have discovered 
all on your own this area of work which is ready to be 
tackled. Up to now, I lacked workers. I am happy that you 
want to join forces with me. I consider it very important 
that you extricate your own material uninfluenced from the 
unconscious, as carefully as possible, My material is very 
voluminous, very complicated, and in part very graphic, up 
to almost completely worked through clarifications. But 
what I completely lack is comparative modern material 

Zarathustra is too strongly consciously formed. Meyrink 
retouches aesthetically; furthermore, I feel he is lacking in 
religious sincerity"? 


The Content 


Liber Novus thus presents a series of active imaginations together 
‘with Jung's attempt to understand their significance, This work of 
understanding encompasses a number of interlinked threads: an 
attempt to understand himself and to integrate and develop the 
various components of his personality; an attempt to understand 
the structure of the human personality in general; an attempt to 
understand the relation of the individual to present-day society 
and to the community of the dead; an attempt to understand the 
psychological and historical effects of Christianity; and an attempt 
to grasp the future religious development of the West. Jung 
discusses many other themes in the work, including the nature of 
self-knowledge; the nature of the soul; the relations of thinking 
and feeling and the psychological types; the relation of inner 
and outer masculinity and femininity; the uniting of opposites; 
solitude; the value of scholarship and learning; the status of science; 
the significance of symbols and how they are to be understood: 
the meaning of the war, madness, divine madness, and psychiatry; 
how the Imitation of Christ is to be understood today; the death 
of God; the historical significance of Nietzsche; and the relation 
of magic and reason, 

“The overall theme of the book is how Jung regains his soul 
and overcomes the contemporary malaise of spiritual alienation. 
This is ultimately achieved through enabling the rebirth of a new 
image of God in his soul and developing a new worldview in the 
form of a psychological and theological cosmology. Liter Novus 
presents the prototype of Jung's conception of the individuation 
process, which he held to be the universal form of individual 
psychological development. Liber Novus itself can be understood 
on one hand as depicting Jung’s individuation process, and on 
the other hand as his elaboration of this concept as a general 
psychological schema. At the beginning of the book, Jung refinds 
his soul and then embarks on a sequence of fantasy adventures, 
which form a consecutive narrative, He realized that until then, 
he had served the spirit of the time, characterized by use and 
value. In addition to this, there existed a spirit of the depths, 
which led to the things of the soul. In terms of Jung’s later

biographical memoir, the spirit of the times corresponds to 
personality No. 1, and the spirit of the depths corresponds to 
personality No.2. Thus this period could be seen as a return to 
the values of personality No. 2. The chapters follow a particular 
format: they begin with the exposition of dramatic visual fantasies. 
In them Jung encounters a series of figures in various settings 
and enters into conversation with them. He is confronted 
with unexpected happenings and shocking statements, He then 
attempts to understand what had transpired, and to formulate 
the significance of these events and statements into general psycho- 
logical conceptions and maxims. Jung held that the significance 
of these fantasies was due to the fact that they stemmed from the 
mythopoeic imagination which was missing in the present rational 
age. The task of individuation lay in establishing a dialogue with 
the fantasy figures—or contents of the collective unconscious— 
and integrating them into consciousness, hence recovering the 
value of the mythopoeic imagination which had been lost to the 
modern age, and thereby reconciling the spirit of the time with 
the spirit of the depth. This task was to form a leitmotif of his 
subsequent scholarly work. 


“A New Spring of Life” 


In 1916, Jung wrote several essays and a short book in which 
he began to attempt to translate some of themes of Liber Novus 
into contemporary psychological language, and to reflect on the 
significance and the generality of his activity. Significantly, in these 
works he presented the first outlines of the main components of 
his mature psychology. A full account of these papers is beyond 
the scope of this introduction, The following overview highlights 
elements that link most directly with Liber Novus. 

In his works between 1911 and 1914, he had principally been 
concerned with establishing a structural account of general 
human functioning and of psychopathology. In addition to his 
earlier theory of complexes, we see that he had already formulated 
conceptions of a phylogenetically acquired unconscious peopled 
by mythic images, of a nonsexual psychic energy, of the gen- 
eral types of introversion and extraversion, of the compensatory 
and prospective function of dreams, and of the synthetic and 
constructive approach to fantasies, While he continued to expand 
and develop these conceptions in detail, a new project emerges 
here: the attempt to provide a temporal account of higher devel- 
‘opment, which he termed the individuation process. This was a 
pivotal theoretical result of his self-experimentation, The full 
elaboration of the individuation process, and its historical and 
cross-cultural comparison, would come to occupy him for the 
rest of his life. 

In 1916, he presented a lecture to the association for analytical 
psychology entitled “The structure of the unconscious,” which 
was first published in a French translation in Flournoy's Archives 
de Psychologie:s* Here, he differentiated two layers of the uncon- 
scious. The first, the personal unconscious, consisted in elements 
acquired during one’ lifetime, together with elements that could 
equally well be conscious."* The second was the impersonal 
unconscious or collective psyche."® While consciousness and 
the personal unconscious were developed and acquired in che 
course of one’s lifetime, the collective psyche was inherited." In this 





essay, Jung discussed the curious phenomena that resulted from 
assimilating the unconscious. He noted that when individuals 
annexed the contents of the collective psyche and regarded them as 
personal attributes, they experienced extreme states of superiority and 
inferiority. He borrowed the term “godlikeness” from Goethe 
and Alfred Adler to characterize this state, which arose from fusing 
the personal and collective psyche, and was one of the dangers 
of analysis, 

Jung wrote that it was a difficult task to differentiate the 
personal and collective psyche. One of the factors one came up 
against was the persona—one’s “mask” or “role.” This represented 
the segment of the collective psyche that one mistakenly regarded 
as individual, When one analyzed this, the personality dissolved 
into the collective psyche, which resulted in the release of a 
stream of fantasies: “All the treasures of mythological thinking 
and feeling are unlocked.” The difference between this state 
and insanity lay in the fact that it was intentional. 

‘Fwo possibilities arose: one could attempt to regressively 
restore persona and return to the prior state, but it was impossible 
to get rid of the unconscious. Alternatively, one could accept 
the condition of godlikeness. However, there was a third way: 
the hermeneutic treatment of creative fantasies. This resulted 
in a synthesis of the individual with the collective psyche, which 
revealed the individual lifeline. This was the process of indi- 
viduation. In a subsequent undated revision of this paper, Jung 
introduced the notion of the anima, as a counterpart to that of 
the persona. He regarded both of these as “subject-imagoes.” 
Here, he defined the anima as “how the subject is seen by the 
collective unconscious.” 

The vivid description of the vicissitudes of the state of 
godlikeness mirror some of Jungs affective states during his 
confrontation with the unconscious. The notion of the differen- 
tiation of the persona and its analysis corresponds to the opening 
section of Liber Novus, where Jung sets himself apart from his 
role and achievements and attempts to reconnect with his soul 
‘The release of mythological fantasies is precisely what ensued in his 
case, and the hermeneutic treatment of creative fantasies was what 
he presented in layer two of Liber Novus. The differentiation of 
the personal and impersonal unconscious provided a theoretical 
understanding of Jung’s mythological fantasies: it suggests that he 
did not view them as stemming from his personal unconscious 
but from the inherited collective psyche. If so, his fantasies 
stemmed from a layer of the psyche that was a collective human 
inheritance, and were not simply idiosyncratic or arbitrary. 

In October of the same year, Jung presented two talks to 
the Psychological Club, The first was titled “Adaptation.” This 
took two forms: adaptation to outer and inner conditions. The 
“inner” was understood to designate the unconscious, Adaptation 
to the “inner” led to the demand for individuation, which was 
contrary to adaptation to others, Answering this demand and 
the corresponding break with conformity led to a tragic guile 
that required expiation and called for a new “collective function,” 
because the individual had to produce values that could serve as a 
substitute for his absence from society. These new values enabled 
one to make reparation to the collective, Individuation was for 
the few. Those who were insufficiently creative should rather 
reestablish collective conformity with a society. The individual

had not only to create new values, but also socially recognizable 
‘ones, as society had a “right to expect realizable values.” 

Read in terms of Jung’s situation, this suggests that his break. 
with social conformity to pursue his “individuation” had fed him 
to the view that he had to produce socially realizable values as an 
expiation. This led to a dilemma: would the form in which Jung 
embodied these new values in Liber Novus be socially acceptable 
and recognizable? This commitment to the demands of society 
separated Jung from the anarchism of the Dadaists. 

The second talk was on “Individuation and collectivity” He 
argued that individuation and collectivity were a pair of opposites 
related by guilt. Society demanded imitation. Through the process 
of imitation, one could gain access to values that were one’s own. 
In analysis, “Through imitation the patient learns individuation, 
because it reactivates his own values.” It is possible to read this 
as a comment on the role of imitation in the analytic treatments 
of those of his patients whom Jung had now encouraged to embark 
on similar processes of development. The claim that this process 
evoked the patient's preexisting values was a counter to the 
charge of suggestion. 

In November, while on military service at Herisau, Jung wrote 
a paper on “The transcendent function,” which was published 
only in 1957, There, he depicted the method of eliciting and 
developing fantasies that he later termed active imagination, and 
explained its therapeutic rationale. This paper can be viewed as 
an interim progress report on Jung's self-experimentation, and 
may profitably be considered as a preface to Liber Novus 

Jung noted that the new attitude gained from analysis became 
obsolece. Unconscious materials were needed to supplement the 
conscious attitude, and to correct its one-sidedness, But because 
energy tension was low in sleep, dreams were inferior expressions 
of unconscious contents. Thus other sources had to be turned 
to, namely, spontaneous fantasies. A recently recovered dream 
book contains a series of dreams from 1917 to 1925. A close 
comparison of this book with the Black Books indicates that his 
active imaginations did not derive directly from his dreams, 
and that these two streams were generally independent. 

Jung described his technique for inducing such spontaneous 
fantasies: “The training consists first of all in systematic exercises 
for climinating critical attention, thus producing a vacuum in 
consciousness.” One commenced by concentrating on a particular 
mood, and attempting to become as conscious as possible of all 
fantasies and associations that came up in connection with it. The 
aim was to allow fantasy free play, without departing from the 
initial affect in a free associative process. This led to a concrete 
or symbolic expression of the mood, which had the result of 
bringing the affect nearer to consciousness, hence making it more 
understandable. Doing this could have a vitalizing effect. Individuals 
could draw, paint, or sculpt, depending on their propensities: 


Visual types should concentrate on the expectation that an 
inner image will be produced. As a rule such a fantasy-image

approaches were possible: creative formulation and understanding, 
Each needed the other, and both were necessary to produce the 
transcendent function, which arose out of the union of conscious 
and unconscious contents. 

For some people, Jung noted, it was simple to note the “other” 
voice in writing and to answer it from the standpoint of the I: “It 
is exactly as iffa dialogue were taking place between two human 
beings...” This dialogue led to the creation of the transcendent 
function, which resulted in a widening of consciousness, This 
depiction of inner dialogues and the means of evoking fantasies 
in a waking state represents Jung's own undertaking in the Black 
Books. The interplay of creative formulation and understanding 
corresponds to Jung's work in Liber Novus. Jung did not publish 
this paper. He later remarked that he never finished his work on 
the transcendent function because he did it only half-heartedly' 

In 1917, Jung published a short book with a long title: The 
Psychology of the Unconscious Processes: An Overview of the Modern 
Theory and Method of Analytical Psychology. In his preface, dated 
December 1916, he proclaimed the psychological processes that 
accompanied the war had brought the problem of the chaotic 
unconscious to the forefront of attention. However, the psychology 
of the individual corresponded to the psychology of the nation, 
and only the transformation of the attitude of the individual 
could bring about cultural renewal’ This articulated the intimate 
interconnection between individual and collective events that was 
at the center of Liber Novus, For Jung, the conjunction between 
his precognitive visions and the outbreak of war had made 
apparent the deep subliminal connections between individual 
fantasies and world events—and hence between the psychology of, 
the individual and that of the nation. What was now required was 
to work out this connection in more detail 

Jung noted that after one had analyzed and integrated 
the contents of the personal unconscious, one came up against 
mythological fantasies that stemmed from the phylogenetic layer 
of the unconscious." The Psychology of the Unconscious Processes 
provided an exposition of the collective, suprapersonal, absolute 
uunconscious—these terms being used interchangeably. Jung 
argued that one needed to separate oneself from the unconscious 
by presenting it visibly as something separate from one. It was 
vital to differentiate the I from the non-I, namely, the collective 
psyche or absolute unconscious, To do this, “man must necessarily 
stand upon firm feet in his I-function; that i, he must full his dury 
toward life completely, so that he may in every respect be a vitally living 
‘member of society.” Jung had been endeavoring to accomplish these 
tasks during this period

The contents of this unconscious were what Jung in 
Transformations and Symbols of the Libido had called typical myths or 
primordial images. He described these “dominants’ as “the ruling 
powers, the Gods, that s, images of dominating laws and principles, 
average regularities in the sequence of images, that the brain has 
received from the sequence of secular processes,”"*One needed to 
pay particular attention to these dominants. Particularly important 
wwas the “detachment ofthe mythological or collective psychological contents 
from the objects of consciousness, and their consolidation as psychological 
realities outside the individual psyche.” This enabled one to come 
to terms with activated residues of our ancestral history. The 
differentiation of the personal from the nonpersonal resulted in 
arelease of energy: 

These comments also mirror his activity: his attempt to 
differentiate the various characters which appeared, and to 
“consolidate them as psychological realities.” The notion that these 
figures had a psychological reality in their own right, and were not 
merely subjective figments, was the main lesson that he attributed 
to the fantasy figure of Elijah: psychic objectivity." 

Jung argued that the era of reason and skepticism inaugurated 
by the French Revolution had repressed religion and irrationalism, 
This in turn had serious consequences, leading to the outbreak of 
irrationalism represented by the world war. It was thus a historical 
necessity to acknowledge the irrational as a psychological factor. 
The acceptance of the irrational forms one of the central themes 
of Liber Novus. 

In The Psychology of the Unconscious Proceses, Jung developed his 
conception of the psychological types. He noted that it was a 
common development that the psychological characteristics of 
the types were pushed to extremes. By what he termed the law 
of enantiodromia, or the reversal into the opposite, the other 
function entered in, namely, feeling for the introvert, and thinking 
for the extravert. ‘These secondary functions were found in the 
unconscious. The development of the contrary function led to 
individuation. As the contrary function was not acceptable to 
consciousness, a special technique was required to come to terms 
swith it, namely the production of the transcendent function, The 
unconscious was a danger when one was not at one with it, But 
with the establishment of the transcendent function, the dis- 
harmony ceased, This rebalancing gave access to the productive and 
beneficent aspects of the unconscious. The unconscious contained 
the wisdom and experience of untold ages, and thus formed an 
unparalleled guide. The development of the contrary function 
appears in the “Mysterium” section of Liber Novus.” The attempt to 
gain the wisdom stored in the unconscious is portrayed throughout 
the book, in which Jung asks his soul to tell him what she sees and 
the meaning of his fantasies. The unconscious is here viewed as a 
source of higher wisdom, He concluded the essay by indicating the 
personal and experiential nature of his new conceptions: “Our age 
is seeking a new spring of life. I found one and drank of it and the 
water tasted good.”** 


The Way to the Self 


In 1918, Jung wrote a paper entitled “On the unconscious,” where 
he noted that all of us stood between two worlds: the world of 


164 Ibid, p43. 
165 Ibid, p 43.

external perception and the world of perception of the unconscious. 
‘This distinction depicts his experience at this time. He wrote 
that Friedrich Schiller had claimed that the approximation of these 
two worlds was through art. By contrast, Jung argued, “I am of 
the opinion that the union of rational and ierational truth is to 
be found not so much in art as in the symbol per se; for it is the 
essence of the symbol to contain both the rational and irrational.” 
Symbols, he maintained, stemmed from the unconscious, and 
the creation of symbols was the most important function of the 
unconscious. While the compensatory function of the unconscious 
‘vas always present, the symbol-creating function was present only 
‘when we were willing to recognize it. Here, we see him continuing 
10 eschew viewing his productions as art. Itwas not art but symbols 
which were of paramount importance here. The recognition and 
recuperation of this symbol-creating power is portrayed in Liber 
‘Novus. It depicts Jung's attempt to understand the psychological 
nature of symbolism and to view his fantasies symbolically. He 
concluded that what was unconscious at any given epoch was 
only relative, and changing What was required now was the 
“remolding of our views in accordance with the active forces of 
the unconscious.”” Thus the task confronting him was one of 
translating the conceptions gained through his confrontation 
with the unconscious, and expressed in a literary and symbolic 
manner in Liber Novus, into a language that was compatible with 
the contemporary outlook 

‘The following year, he presented a paper in England before 
the Society of Psychical Research, of which he was an honorary 
member, on “The psychological foundations of the belief in 
spirits.””" He differentiated between two situations in which the 
collective unconscious became active, In the first, it became 
activated through a crisis in an individual’s life and the collapse 
of hopes and expectations. In the second, it became activated at 
times of great social, political, and religious upheaval. At such 
moments, the factors suppressed by the prevailing attitudes 
accumulate in the collective unconscious. Strongly intuitive 
individuals become aware of these and try to translate them 
into communicable ideas. If they succeeded in translating the 
unconscious into a communicable language, this had a redeeming 
effect. The contents of the unconscious had a disturbing effect. 
In the first situation, the collective unconscious might replace 
reality, which is pathological. In the second situation, the individual 
may feel disorientated, but the state is not pathological. This 
differentiation suggests that Jung viewed his own experience as 
falling under the second heading—namely, the activation of the 
collective unconscious due to the general cultural upheaval. Thus 
his initial fear of impending insanity in 1913 lay in his failure to 
realize this distinction. 

In 1918, he presented a series of seminars to the Psychological 
Club on his work on typology, and was engaged in extensive 
scholarly research on this subject at this time. He developed 
and expanded the themes articulated in these papers in 1921 
in Psychological Types. As regards the working over of themes 
of Liber Novus, the most important section was chapter 5, “The 
type problem in poetry.” The basic issue discussed here was how 
the problem of opposites could be resolved through the produc- 
tion of the uniting or reconciling symbol, This forms one of the

iow 


central themes of Liber Novus. Jung presented detailed analysis 
of the issue of the resolution of the problem of opposites in 
Hinduism, Taoism, Meister Eckhart, and, in present times, in 
the work of Carl Spitteler. This chapter can also be read in terms 
of a meditation on some of the historical sources that directly 
informed his conceptions in Liber Novus. It also heralded the 
introduction of an important method. Rather than directly discuss- 
ing the issue of the reconciliation of opposites in Liber Novus, he 
sought out historical analogies and commented upon them. 

In 1921, the “self” emerged as a psychological concept. Jung 
defined it as follows: 


Inasmuch as the I is only the center of my field of 
consciousness, it is not identical with the totality of my 
psyche, being merely a complex among other complexes. 
Hence I discriminate between the I and the self, since the I 
is only the subject of my consciousness, while the self is the 
subject of my totality: hence it also includes the uncon- 
scious psyche, In this sense the self would be an (ideal) 
greatness which embraces and includes the I. In unconscious 
fantasy the self often appears as the super-ordinated or ideal 
personality, as Faust isin relation to Goethe and Zarathustra 
to Nietzsche." 


He equated the Hindu notion of Brahman/Atman with the self 
‘Atthe same time, Jung provided a definition of the soul. He argued 
that the soul possessed qualities that were complementary to the 
persona, containing those qualities that the conscious attitude 
lacked. This complementary character of the soul also affected its 
sexual charactes, so that a man had a feminine soul, or anima, and 
awoman had a masculine soul, or animus.” This corresponded to 
the fact that men and women had both masculine and feminine 
traits, He also noted that the soul gave rise to images that were 
assumed to be worthless from the rational perspective. There were 
four ways of using them: 


The first possibility of making use of them is artistic, if 
one isin any way gifted in thatdirection; second isphilosophical 
speculation; a third is quis-eligios, leading to heresy and 
the founding of sects; and a fourth way of employing the 
dynamis of these images is to squander it in every form 
of licentiousness." 


From this perspective, the psychological utilization of these 
images would represent a “fifth way.” For it to succeed, psychology 
had to distinguish itself clearly from art, philosophy, and religion. 
This necessity accounts for Jung's rejection of the alternatives. 

In the subsequent Black Books, he continued to elaborate his 
“mythology.” The figures developed and transformed into one 
another. The differentiation of the figures was accompanied 
by their coalescence, as he came to regard them as aspects of 
underlying components of the personality. On January 5, 1922, 
he had a conversation with his soul concerning both his vocation 
and Liber Novus: 


[1] I feel that I must speak to you. Why do you not let me 
sleep, as I am tired? I feel that the disturbance comes from

[Soul:] Now is no time to sleep, but you should be awake 
and prepare important matters in nocturnal work. 

The great work begins. 

[13] What great worke 

[Soul] The work that should now be undertaken, It is a 
great and difficult work. There is no time to sleep, if you 
find no time ducing the day to remain in the work. 

[1] Bur I had no idea that something of this kind was, 
taking place. 

[Soul:] But you could have told by the fact that I have 
been disturbing your sleep for a long time. You have been 
100 unconscious for along time. Now you must go to a 
higher level of consciousness. 

[1}] I am ready. What is i? Speak! 

[Soul] You should listen: to no longer be a Christian is 
easy. But what next? For more is yet to come. Everything 
nothing to say. But you should speak. Why have you 
received the revelation? You should not hide it. You 
concern yourself with the form? Is the form important, 
when it is a matter of revelation? 

[0:] But you are not thinking that I should publish what I 
have written? That would be a misfortune. And who would 
understand it? 

[Souk] No, listen! You should not break up a 

marriage, namely the marriage with me, no person 
should supplant me ... [want to rule alone 

[EJ] So you want to rule? From whence do you take 

the right for such a presumption? 

[Soul:] This right comes to me because I serve you 

and your calling. I could just as well say, you came first, 
but above all your calling comes first. 

[1] But what is my calling? 

[Soul] The new religion and ies proclamation. 

[1] Oh God, how should I do this? 

[Soul] Do not be of such little faith. No one knows 

it as you do. There is no one who could say it as well 

as you could.

[Sout] Ask yourself if I am lying, I speak the truth.”

His soul here pointedly urged him to publish his material, at 
which he balked. Three days later, his soul informed him that 
the new religion “expresses itself only in the transformation of 
human relations. Relations do not let themselves be replaced 
by the deepest knowledge. Moreover a religion does not consist 
only in knowledge, but at its visible level in a new ordering of 
human affairs. Therefore expect no further knowledge from me. 
You know everything that is to be known about the manifested 
revelation, but you do not yet live everything that is to be lived 
at this time,” Jung’s “r” replied, “I can fully understand and accept 
this. However, it is dark to me, how the knowledge could be 
transformed into life. You must teach me this.” His soul said, 
“There is not much to say about this, It is not as rational as you 
are inclined to think. The way is symbolic.””* 

Thus the task confronting Jung was how to realize and embody

what he had learned through his self-investigation into life 
During this period the themes of the psychology of religion 
and the relation of religion to psychology became increasingly 
prominent in his work, starting from his seminar in Polzeath 
in Cornwall in 1923. He attempted to develop a psychology of 
the religious-making process. Rather than proclaiming a new 
prophetic revelation, his interest lay in the psychology of religious 
experiences. The task was to depict the translation and transposi- 
tion of the numinous experience of individuals into symbols, and 
eventually into the dogmas and creeds of organized religions, 
and, finally to study the psychological function of such symbols, 
For such a psychology of the religion-making process to succeed, 
it was essential that analytical psychology, while providing an 
affirmation of the religious attitude, did not suecumb to becoming 
acreed.”” 

In 1922, Jung wrote a paper on “The relation of analytical 
psychology to poetic art works.” He differentiated two types of 
work: the first, which sprang entirely from the author's intention, 
and the second, which seized the author. Examples of such 
symbolic works were the second part of Goethe's Faust and 
Nietasche’s Zarathustra, He held that these works stemmed 
from the collective unconscious. In such instances, the creative 
process consisted in the unconscious activation of an archetypal 
image. The archetypes released in us a voice that was stronger 
than our own: 


“Whoever speaks in primordial images speaks with a thousand 
voices; he enthrals and overpowers ... he transmutes our 
personal destiny into the destiny of mankind, and evokes 
in us all those beneficent forces that ever and anon have 
enabled humanity to find a refuge from every peril and to 
outlive the longest night." 


The artist who produced such works educated the spirit of 
the age, and compensated the one-sidedness of the present. In 
describing the genesis of such symbolic works, Jung seemingly had 
his own activities in mind. Thus while Jung refused to regard 
Liber Novus as “art,” his reflections on its composition were 
nevertheless a critical source of his subsequent conceptions and 
theories of art. The implicit question that this paper raised was 
whether psychology could now serve this function of educating 
the spirit of the age and compensating the one-sidedness of the 
present. From this period onward, he came to conceive of the task 
of his psychology in precisely such a manner.” 





Publication Deliberations 


From 1922 onward, in addition to discussions with Emma 
Jung and Toni Wolff, Jung had extensive discussions with Cary 
Baynes and Wolfgang Stockmayer concerning what to do with 
Liber Novus, and around its potential publication, Because these 
discussions took place when he was still working on it, they are 


critically important. Cary Fink was born in 1883, She studied 
at Vassar College, where she was taught by Kristine Mann, 
who became one of Jung’ earliest followers in the United 
States. In 1910, she married Jaime de Angulo, and completed her 
medical training at Johns Hopkins in 1911. In 1921, she left him, 
and went to Ziiich with Kristine Mann, She entered analysis with 
Jung, She never practiced analysis, and Jung highly respected her 
critical intelligence. In 1927, she married Peter Baynes. They 
were subsequently divorced in 1931, Jung asked her to make 
a fresh transcription of Liber Novus, because he had added a lor 
of material since the previous transcription. She undertook this 
in 1924 and 1925, when Jung was in Africa. Her typewriter.was 
heavy, so she first copied it by hand and then typed it out. 

These notes recount her discussions with Jung and are written, 
in the form of letters to him, but were not sent. 


OCTOBER 2, 1922 
In another book of Meyrink’s the “White Dominican,” 
you said he made use of exactly the same symbolism that 
hhad come to you in the first vision that revealed to your 
unconscious. Furthermore you said, he had spoken of a 
“Red Book” which contained certain mysteries and the 
book that you are writing about the unconscious, you have 
called the “Red Book”. Then you said you were in doubt 
as to what to do about that book. Meyrink you said could 
throw his into novel form and i was all right, but you could 
only command the scientific and philosophical method 
and that stuff you couldn’t cast into that mold. I said you 
could use the Zarathustra form and you said that was true, 
but you were sick of that. I am too. Then you said you had 
thought of making an autobiography out of it, That would 
seem to me by far the best, because then you would tend 
to write as you spoke which was in a very colosful way. But 
apart from any difficulty with the form, you said you dreaded 
making it public because it was like selling your house. 
But I jumped upon you with both feet there and said it 
wasn't a bit like that because you and the book stood for 
a constellation of the Universe, and that to take the book 
as being purely personal was to identify yourself with it 
which was something you would not think of permitting to 
your patients. . .Then we laughed over my having caught 
you red-handed as it were. Goethe had been caught in the 
same difficulty in the 2 part of Faust in which he had 
gotten into the unconscious and found it so difficult to 
get the right form that he had finally died leaving the 
MBs, as such in his drawer. So much of what you had 
experienced you said, would be counted as sheer lunacy 
that if it were published you would lose out altogether not 
only as a scientist, but as a human being, but not I said if 
you went at it from the Dichtung und Wahrheit [Poetry 
and Truth] angle, then people could make their own 
selection as to which was which." You objected to pre~

and unconscious fantasies, he noted that examples where such material had been subjected to aesthetic elaboration could be found in literature, and that "I would single

senting any of it as Dichtung when it was all Wahrheit, but 
it does not seem to me falseness to make use of that much 
of a mask in order to protect yourself from Philistia—and 
after all, as I said Philistia has its rights, confronted with the 
choice of you as a lunatic, and themselves as inexperienced 
fools they have to choose the former alternative, but if 
they can place you as a poet, their faces are saved. Much 
of your material you said has come to you as runes & the 
explanation of those runes sounds like the veriest nonsense, 
but that does not matter if the end product is sense, In 
your case I said, apparently you have become conscious of 
more of the steps of creation than ever anyone before. In 
most cases the mind evidently drops out of the irrelevant 
stuff automatically and delivers the end product, whereas 
you bring along the whole business, matrix process and 
product. Naturally itis frightfully more difficult to handle, 
‘Then my hour was up. 


JANUARY 1923 

What you told me some time ago set me thinking, and 
suddenly the other day while I was reading the “Vorspiel 
auf dem Theater” [prelude in the theater]."* it came to 
me that you too ought ro make use of that principle which 
Goethe has handled so beautifully all through Faust, namely, 
the placing in opposition of the creative and eternal with 
the negative and transient. You may not see right away what 
this has to do with the Red Book, but I will explain. As I 
understand it in this book you are going to challenge men 
to a new way of looking at their souls, at any rate there is 
going to be in it a good deal that will be out of the grasp of 
the ordinary man, just as at one period of your own life you 
would scarcely have understood i. In a way it is a “jewel” 
‘you are giving to the world is it now? My idea is that it needs 
a sort of protection in order not to be thrown into the gutter 
and finally made away with by a strangely clad Jew: 

The best protection you could devise, it seems to me, 
‘would be to put in incorporate the book itself an exposition 
of the forces that will attempt to destroy it. It is one of 
your great gifts strength of seeing the black as well as the 
white of every given situation, so you will know better 
than most of the people who attack the book, what it is 
that they want to destroy. Could you not take the wind out 
of their sails by writing their criticism for them? Perhaps 
that is the very thing you have done in the introduction. 
Perhaps you would rather assume towards the public the 
attitude of “Take or leave it, and be blessed or be damned 
whichever you prefer” That would be all right, whatever 
there is of truth in it is going to survive in any case. But I 
would like to see you do the other thing if it did not call 
for too much effort. 





JANUARY 26, 1924 

You had the night before had a dream in which I appeared 
in a disguise and was to do work on the Red Book and 
you had been thinking about it all that day and dusing Dr. 
Wharton's hour preceding mine especially (pleasant for her 
1 must say) ... As you had said you had made up your mind to 


INTRODUCTION | 213, 


turn over to me all of your unconscious material represented 
by the Red Book etc. to see what I as a stranger and impartial 
observer would say about it. You thought I had a good critique 
and an impartial one. Toni you said was deeply interwoven 
with it and besides did not take any interest in the thing 
in itself, nor in getting it into usable form, She is lost in 
“bird uttering” you said. For yourself, you said you had 
always known what to do with your ideas, but here you were 
baffled. When you approached them you became enmeshed 
as it were and could no longer be sure of anything. You 
were certain some of them had great importance, but you 
could not find the appropriate form—as they were now you 
said they might come out of a madhouse. So then you said 
I was to copy down the contents of the Red Book—once 
before you had had it copied, but you had since then added 
a great deal of material, so you wanted it done again and 
you would explain things to me as I went along, for you 
understood nearly everything in it you said. In this way we 
could come to discuss many things which never came up 
in my analysis and I could understand your ideas from the 
foundation. You told me then something more of your own 
attitude toward the “Red Book” You said some of it hurt 
your sense of the fitness of things terribly, and that you 
had shrunk from putting it down as it came to you, but that 
you had started on the principle of “voluntariness” that is of 
making no corrections and so you had stuck to that. Some of 
the pictures were absolutely infantile, but were intended 
so t0 be. There were various figures speaking, Elias, Father 
Philemon, etc. but all appeared to be phases of what you 
thought ought to be called “the master.” You were sure that 
this latter was the same who inspired Buddha, Mani, Christ, 
Mahomet—all those who may be said to have communed with 
God" But the others had identified with him. You abso- 
Iutely refused to, It could not be for you, you said, you had 
to remain the psychologist—the person who understood the 
process, I said then that the thing to be done was to enable the 
‘world to understand the process also without their getting the 
notion that they had the Master caged as it were at their 
beck & call. They had to think of him as a pillar of fire per- 
petually moving on and forever out of human grasp. Yes, 
you said itwas something like that. Perhaps it cannot yet be 
done. As you talked I grew more and more aware of the 
immeasurability of the ideas which are filling you. You said 
they had the shadow of eternity upon them and I could 
feel the truth of it."* 


On January 30, she noted that Jung said of a dream which she 
had told him: 


“That it was a preparation for the Red Book, because the Red 
Book told of the battle between the world of reality and the 
‘world of the spirit, You said in that battle you had been very 
nearly torn asunder but that you had managed to keep your 
feet on the earth & make an effect on reality. That you said

214 | LIBER NOVUS 


‘There is an undated fragment of a letter draft to an unidentified 

person in which Cary Baynes expresses her view of the significance 

of Liber Novus, and the necessity of its publication 
Lam absolutely thunderstruck, for example, as I read the 
Red Book, and see all that is told there for the Right Way 
for us of today, to find how Toni has kept it out of her system, 
She wouldn’t have an unconscious spot in her psyche had 
she digested even as much of the Red Book as I have read & 
that I should think was not a third ora fourth, And another 
difficult thing to understand is why she has no interest in 
seeing him publish it. There are people in my country who 
would read it from cover to cover without stopping to 
breathe scarcely, so does it re-envisage and clarify the things 
that are today, staggering everyone who is trying to find the 
clue to life ... he has put into itall the vigor and color of his 
speech, all the directness and simplicity that come when as 
at Cornwall the fire burns in him.%* 

Of course it may be that as he says, if he published it as. 
it is, he would forever be hors du combat in the world of 
rational science, but then there must be some way around 
that, some way of protecting himself against stupidity, in 
order that the people who would want the book need not 
go without for the time it will take the majority to get 
ready for it. I always knew’he must be able to write the 
fire that he can speak—and here itis. His published books 
are doctored up for the world at large, or rather they are 
written out of his head & this out of his heart.” 


These discussions vividly portray the depth of Jung's 
deliberations concerning the publication of Liber Novus, his 
sense of its centrality in comprehending the genesis of his 
work, and his fear that the work would be misunderstood. 
‘The impression that the style of the work would make on an 
unsuspecting public strongly concerned Jung, He later recalled 
to Aniela Jaffé that the work still needed a suitable form in 
which it could be brought into the world because it sounded like 
prophecy, which was not to his taste. 

‘There appears to have been some discussion concerning these 
issues in Jung's circle, On May 29, 1924, Cary Baynes noted a 
discussion with Peter Baynes in which he argued that Liber Novus 
could be understood only by someone who had known Jung. By 
contrast, she thought that the book 


‘was the record of the passage of the universe through the soul 
of a man, and just as a person stands by the sea and listens to 
that very strange and awful music and cannot explain why his 
heart aches, or why a cry of exaltation wants to leap from his 
throat, so I thought it would be with the Red Book, and that 
aman would be perforce lifted out of himself by the majesty 
of it, and swung to heights he had never been before” 


“There are further signs that Jung circulated copies of Liber Novus 
to confidantes, and that the material was discussed together 


186 The reference isto the Polzeath seminar. 


with the possibilities of its publication. One such colleague 
was Wolfgang Stockmayer. Jung met Stockmayer in 1907. In his 
unpublished obituary, Jung nominated him as the first German 
to be interested in his work. He recalled that Stockmayer was 
a true friend. They traveled together in Italy and Switzerland, 
and there was seldom a year in which they did not meet 
Jung commented: 


He distinguished himself through his great interest and 
equally great understanding for pathological psychic 
processes. I also found with him a sympathetic reception 
for my broader viewpoint, which became of importance 
for my later comparative psychological works.” 


Stockmayer accompanied Jung in “the valuable penetration 
of our psychology” into classical Chinese philosophy, the mystical 
speculations of India and Tantric yoga™ 


On December 22, 1924, Stockmayer wrote to Jung: 


1 often long for the Red Book, and I would like to have a 
transcript of what is available; I failed to do so when I had 
it, as things go. I recently fantasized about a kind of journal 
of “Documents” in a loose form for materials from the 
“forge of the unconscious,” with words and colors."* 


It appears that Jung sent some material to him. On April 30, 
1925, Stockmayer wrote to Jung: 


In the meantime we have gone through “Scrutinies,” and 
it is the same impression as with the great wandering” 
A selected collective milieu for such from the Red Book 
is certainly worth trying out, although your commentary 
would be quite desired. Since a certain adjacent center of 
yours lies here, ample access to sources is of great significance, 
consciously and unconsciously: And 1 obviously fantasize 
about “facsimiles,” which you will understand: you need 
not fear extraversion magic from me. Painting also has 
great appeal 


Jung's manuscript “Commentaries” (see Appendix B) was possibly 
connected with these discussions. 

“Thus figures in Jung's circle held differing views concerning 
the significance of Liber Novus and whether it should be published, 
which may have had bearings on Jung's eventual decisions, Cary 
Baynes did not complete the transcription, getting as far as the 
first twenty-seven pages of Serutinies. For the next few years, 
her time was taken up with the translation of Jung's essays into 
English, followed by the translation of the I Ching. 

‘At some stage, which I estimate to be in the mid-twenties, 
Jung went back to the Draft and edited it again, deleting and 
adding material on approximately 250 pages. His revisions 
served to modernize the language and terminology.” He also 


187 I suspect that this may have been written to her ex-husband, Jaime de Angulo. On July 10, 1924, he wrote to her: “I daresay you have been as busy as T have, with that 


material of Jung's 
knew I would feel so proud of you" (CFB).

revised some of the material that he had already transcribed 
into the calligraphic volume of Liber Novus, as well as some 
material that was left out. It is hard to see why he undertook 
this unless he was seriously considering publishing it. 

In 1925, Jung presented his seminars on analytical psychology 
to the Psychological Club. Here, he discussed some of the 
important fantasies in Liber Novus. He described how they 
unfolded and indicated how they formed the basis of the ideas 
in Psychological Types and the key to understanding its genesis, 
The seminar was transcribed and edited by Cary Baynes. That 
same year, Peter Baynes prepared an English translation of the 
Septem Sermones ad Mortuos, which was privately published.”*Jung 
gave copies to some of his English-speaking students. In a 
letter that is presumably a reply to one from Henry Murray 
thanking him for a copy, Jung wrote 


1am deeply convinced, that those ideas that came to me, 
are really quite wonderful things. I can easily say that 
(without blushing), because I know, how resistant and 
how foolishly obstinate I was, when they first visited me 
and what a trouble ie was, until I could read this symbolic 
language, so much superior to my dull conscious mind.” 


It is possible that Jung may have considered the publication 
of the Sermones as a trial for the publication of Liber Novus. 
Barbara Hannah claims that he regretted publishing it and that 
“he felt strongly that it should only have been written in the 
Red Book."** 

At some point, Jung wrote a manuscript entitled 
“Commentaries,” which provided a commentary on chapters 9, 
10, and 11 of Liber Primus (see Appendix B). He had discussed 
some of these fantasies in his 1925 seminar, and he goes into 
more detail here, From the style and conceptions, I would 
estimate that this text was written in the mid-twenties. He may 
have written—or intended to write—further “commentaries” 
for other chapters, but these have not come to light. This manu- 
script indicates the amount of work he put into understanding 
each and every detail of his fantasies. 

Jung gave a number of people copies of Liber Novus: Cary 
Baynes, Peter Baynes, Aniela Jaffé, Wolfgang Stockmayer, and 
‘Toni Wolff. Copies may also have been given to others. In 1937, 
a fire destroyed Peter Baynes’s house, and damaged his copy of 
Liber Novus. A few years later, he wrote to Jung asking if by chance 
he had another copy, and offered to translate it.” Jung replied: “I 
will try whether I can procure another copy of the Red Book. 
Please don’t worry about translations, I am sure there are 2.0 3 
translations already. But I don’t know of what and by whom." 
This supposition was presumably based on the number of copies 
of the work in circulation, 

Jung let the following individuals read and/or look at Liber 
Novus: Richard Hull, Tina Keller, James Kirsch, Ximena Roelli 
de Angulo (as a child), and Kurt Wolff. Aniela Jaffé read the 
Black Books, and Tina Keller was also allowed to read sections of 
the Black Books. Jung most likely showed the book to other close 
associates, such as Emil Medtner, Franz Riklin Sr, Erika Schlegel, 
Hans Triib, and Marie-Louise von Franz. It appears that he allowed

those people to read Liber Novus whom he fully trusted and whom 
he felt had a full grasp of his ideas. Quite a number of his students 
did not fit into this category 


The Transformation 
of Psychotherapy 


Liber Novus is of critical significance for grasping the emergence of 
Jung's new model of psychotherapy. In 1912, in Transformation and 
Symbols ofthe Libido, he considered the presence of mythological 
fantasies—such as are present in Liber Novus—to be the signs of 
a loosening of the phylogenetic layers of the unconscious, and 
indicative of schizophrenia. Through his self-experimentation, 
he radically revised this position: what he now considered critical 
‘was not the presence of any particular content, but the attitude 
of the individual toward it and, in particular, whether an indi- 
vidual could accommodate such material in their worldview: This 
explains why he commented in his afterword to Liber Novus that to 
the superficial observer, the work would seem like madness, and 
could have become so, ifhe had failed to contain and comprehend 
the experiences In Liber Secundus, chapter 15, he presents a 
critique of contemporary psychiatry, highlighting its incapacity 
to differentiate religious experience or divine madness from 
psychopathology. If the content of visions or fantasies had no 
diagnostic value, he held that it was nevertheless critical to view 
them carefully 

Out of his experiences, he developed néw conceptions of the 
aims and methods of psychotherapy. Since its inception at the 
end of the nineteenth century, modern psychotherapy had been 
primarily concerned with the treatment of functi 
disorders, or neuroses, as they came to be known. From the time 
of the First World War onward, Jung reformulated the prac~ 
tice of psychotherapy. No longer solely preoccupied with the 
treatment of psychopathology, it became a practice to enable 
the higher development of the individual through fostering the 
individuation process. This was to have far-reaching consequences 
not only for the development of analytical psychology but also 
for psychotherapy as a whole. 

To demonstrate the validity of the conceptions that he derived in 
Liber Novus, Jung attempted to show that the processes depicted 
within it were not unique and that the conceptions which he 
developed in it were applicable to others. To study the productions 
of his patients, he built up an extensive collection of their paintings. 
So that his patients were not separated from their images, he 
would generally ask them to make copies for him." 

During this period, he continued to instruct his patients as 
to how to induce visions in a waking state. In 1926, Christiana 
“Morgan came to Jung for analysis, She had been drawn to his ideas 
on reading Psychological Types, and tured to him for assistance 
with her problems with relationships and her depressions. In a 
session in 1926, Morgan noted Jung's advice to her on how to

use the retina of the eye at first in order to objectify: Then 
instead of keeping on trying to force the image out you just 
want to look in. Now when you see these images you want 
to hold them and see where they take you—-how they change. 
‘And you want to try to get into the picture yourself—to 
become one of the actors. When I first began to do this I 
saw landscapes. Then I learned how to put myself into the 
landscape, and the figures would talk to me and I would 
answer them... People said he has an artistic temperament. 
But it was only that my unconscious was swaying me. Now 
T learn to act its drama as well as the drama of the outer life 
& so nothing can hurt me now. I have written 1000 pages 
of material from the unconscious (Told the vision of a giant 
who turned into an egg).** 


He described his own experiments in detail to his patients, and 
instructed them to follow suit. His role was one of supervising 
them in experimenting with their own stream of images. Morgan 
noted Jung saying: 


Now I feel as though I ought to say something to you 
about these phantasies . .. The phantasies now seem t0 
be rather thin and full of repetitions of the same motives 
‘There isn’t enough fire and heat in them. They ought to 
be more burning... You must be in them more, that is you 
must be your own conscious critical self in them—imposing 
your own judgments arid criticisms... I can explain what I 
mean by telling you of my own experience. I was writing 
in my book and suddenly saw a man standing watch over 
my shoulder. One of the gold dots from my book flew 
up and hit him in the eye. He asked me if I would take 
it out. I said no—not unless he told me who he was. He 
said he wouldn't, You see I knew that. If I had done what 
he asked then he would have sunk into the unconscious 
and I would have missed the point of it ie why he had 
appeared from the unconscious at all, finally he told me 
that he would tell me the meaning of certain hieroglyphs 
which I had had a few days previous, This he did and I 
took the thing out of his eye and he vanished.** 


Jung went so far as to suggest that his patients prepare their own 
Red Books. Morgan recalled him saying 


I should advise you to put it all down as beautifully as you 
can—in some beautifully bound book. It will seem as if you 
were making the visions banal—but then you need to do 
that—then you are freed from the power of them. If you 
do that with these eyes for instance they will cease to draw 
you. You should never try to make the visions come again. 
‘Think of it in your imagination and try to paint it. Then 
when these things are in some precious book you can go 
to the book & turn over the pages & for you it will be your 
church—your cathedral—the silent places of your spirit 
where you will find renewal. IF anyone tells you that it is 
morbid or neurotic and you listen to them—then you will 
lose your soul—for in that book is your soul,™* 


Inaletter to J. A. Gilbert in 1929, he commented on his procedure: 


I found sometimes, that it is of great help in handling such 
a case, to encourage them, to express their peculiar contents 
cither in the form of writing or of drawing and painting. 
‘There are so many incomprehensible intuitions in such cases, 
phantasy fragments that rise from the unconscious, for which 
there is almost no suitable language. I let my patients find 
their own symbolic expressions, their “mythology.”" 


Philemon’s Sanctuary 


In the 1920s, Jung's interest increasingly shifted from the 
transcription of Liber Novus and the elaboration of his mythology 
in the Black Books to working on his tower in Bollingen. In 1920, 
he purchased some land on the upper shores of Lake Ziirich in 
Bollingen. Prior to this, he and his family sometimes spent holidays 
camping around Lake Ziiich, He felt the need to represent his 
innermost thoughts in stone and to build a completely primitive 
dwelling: “Words and paper, however, did not seem real enough 
to me; something more was needed.”** He had to make a confession 
in stone. The tower was a “representation of individuation.” Over 
the years, he painted murals and made carvings on the walls. The 
tower may be regarded as a three-dimensional continuation of 
Liber Novus: its “Liber Quartus.” At the end of Liber Secundus, Jung 
‘wrote: “I must catch up with a piece of the Middle Ages—within 
myself We have only finished the Middle Ages of—others. I 
must begin early, in that period when the hermits died out.” 
Significantly, the tower was deliberately built as a structure from 
the Middle Ages, with no modern amenities. The tower was an 
ongoing, evolving work. He carved this inscription on its wall 
“Philemonis sacrum—Fausti poenitentia” (Philemon’s Shrine— 
Faust’s Repentance) (One of the murals in the tower is a portrait 
of Philemon) On April 6, 1929, Jung wrote to Richard Wilhelm: 
“Why are there no worldly cloisters for men, who should live 
outside the times!”™* 

On January 9, 1923, Jung’s mother died. On December 23/24, 
December, 1923, he had the following dream: 


Lam on military service. Marching with a battalion, Ina wood 
by Ossingen I come across excavations at a crossroads: 1 
meter high stone figure of a frog or a toad with a head, 
Behind this sits a boy with a toad’s head, Then the bust of a 
man with an anchor hammered into the region of his heart, 
Roman, A second bust from around 1640, the same motif. 
Then mummified corpses. finally there comes a barouche in 
the style of the seventeenth century: In it sits someone who 
is dead, but still alive, She turns her head, when I address her 
as “Miss” I am aware that “Miss” is a ttle of nobility" 


A few years later, he grasped the significance of this dream. 
He noted on December 4, 1926: 


Only now do I see for that the dream of 23/24 December 
1923 means the death of the anima (“She does not know 
that she is dead”). This coincides with the death of my

mother . . Since the death of my mother, the A. [Anima] 
has fallen silent. Meaningful! 


A few years later, he had a few further dialogues with his soul, 
but his confrontation with the anima had effectively reached 
a closure at this point. On January 2, 1927, he had a dream set 
in Liverpool: 


Several young Swiss and I are down by the docks in 
Liverpool. Ie is a dark rainy night, with smoke and clouds 
‘We walk up to the upper part of town, which lies on a plateau. 
‘We come to a small circular lake in a centrally located garden, 
In the middle of this there is an island. The men speak of a 
Swiss who lives here in such a sooty, dark diety city. But I 
see that on the island stands a magnolia tree covered with 
red flowers illuminated by an eternal sun, and think, “Now 
I know, why this Swiss fellow lives here. He apparently also 
knows why,” I see a city map: [Plate]. 


Jung then painted a mandala based upon this map: He attached 
great significance to this dream, commenting later: 


This dream represented my situation at the time, I can 
still see the grayish-yellowish raincoats, glistening with the 
wetness of the rain, Everything was extremely unpleasant, 
black and opaque, just as I felt then, But I had had a vision 
of unearthly beauty, and that was why I was able to live 
at all... I saw that here the goal had been reached. One 
could not go beyond the center. The center is the goal, 
and everything is directed toward that center. Through this 
dream I understood that the self is the principle and arche- 
type of orientation and meaning 


Jung added that he himself was the one Swiss. The “I” was 
not the self, but from there one could see the divine miracle. The 
small light resembled the great light. Henceforth, he stopped 
painting mandalas. The dream had expressed the unconscious 
developmental process, which was not linear, and he found it 
completely satisfying, He felt utterly alone at that time, preoccu- 
pied with something great that others didn’t understand. In the 
dream, only he saw the tree. While they stood in the darkness, 
the tree appeared radiantly, Had he not had such a vision, his life 
would have lost meaning "* 

The realization was that the self is the goal of individuation 
and that the process of individuation was not linear, but consisted 
in a circumambulation of the self. This realization gave him 
strength, for otherwise the experience would have driven him 
or those around him crazy:” He felt that the mandala drawings 
showed him the self “in its saving function” and that this was 
his salvation. The task now was one of consolidating these insights 
into his life and science. 

In his 1926 revision of The Psychology ofthe Unconscious Processes, 
he highlighted the significance of the midlife transition. He 
argued that the first half of life could be characterized as the 
natural phase, in which the prime aim was establishing oneself 
in the world, gaining an income, and raising a family. The second

INTRODUCTION | 217 


half of life could be characterized as the cultural phase, which 
involved a revaluation of earlier values. The goal in this period 
‘was one of conserving previous values together with the recog- 
nition of their opposites. This meant that individuals had 
to develop the undeveloped and neglected aspects of their 
personality." The individuation process was now conceived 
as the general pattern of human development. He argued that 
there was a lack of guidance for this transition in contemporary 
society, and he saw his psychology as filling this lacuna, Outside 
of analytical psychology, Jung’s formulations have had an 
impact on the field of adult developmental psychology. Clearly, 
his crisis experience formed the template for this conception of 
the requirements of the two halves of life. Liber Novus depicts 
Jung’s reappraisal of his previous values, and his attempt to 
develop the neglected aspects of his personality. Thus it formed 
the basis of his understanding of how the midlife transition could 
be successfully navigated. 

In 1928 he published a small book, The Relations berween the I and 
the Unconscious, which was an expansion of his 1916 paper “The 
structure of the unconscious.” Here, he expanded upon the “interior 
drama” of the transformation process, adding a section dealing in 
detail with the process of individuation, He noted that after one 
had dealt with the fantasies from the personal sphere, one met 
‘with fantasies from the impersonal sphere. These were not simply 
arbitrary, but converged upon a goal. Hence these later fantasies 
could be described as processes of initiation, which provided their 
nearest analogy. For this process to take place, active participation 
was required: “When the conscious mind participates actively 
and experiences each stage of the process ... then the next image 
always starts off on the higher level that has been won, and 
purposiveness develops.”*” 

After the assimilation of the personal unconscious, the 
differentiation of the persona, and the overcoming of the state 
of godlikeness, the next stage that followed was the integration 
of the anima for men and of the animus for women. Jung argued 
that just as it was essential for a man to distinguish between what 
he was and how he appeared to others, it was equally essential to 
become conscious of “his invisible relations to the unconscious” 
and hence to differentiate himself from the anima. He noted 
that when the anima was unconscious, it was projected, For a 
child, the first bearer of the soul-image was the mother, and 
thereafter, the women who aroused a man’s feelings. One needed 
to objectify the anima and to pose questions to her, by the 
method of inner dialogue or active imagination, Everyone, he 
claimed, had this ability to hold dialogues with him- or herself. 
Active imagination would thus be one form of inner dialogue, a 
type of dramatized thinking. It was critical to disidentify from 
the thoughts that arose, and to overcome the assumption that 
one had produced them oneself” What was most essential was 
not interpreting or understanding the fantasies, but experiencing 
them, This represented a shift from his emphasis on creative 
formulation and understanding in his paper on the transcendent 
function. He argued that one should treat the fantasies com- 
pletely literally while one was engaged in them, but symbolically 
when one interpreted them" This was a direct description of 
Jung’s procedure in the Black Books. The task of such discussions 


218 | LIDER Novus 


‘was to objectify the effects of the anima and to become conscious 
of the contents that underlay these, thereby integrating these into 
consciousness. When one had become familiar with the unconscious 
processes reflected in the anima, the anima then became a function 
of the relationship between consciousness and the unconscious, as 
opposed to an autonomous complex. Again, this process of the 
integration of the anima was the subject of Liter Novus and the 
Black Books. (It also highlights the fact that the fantasies in Liber 
Novus should be read symbolically and not literally. To take 
statements from them out of context and to cite them literally 
would represent a serious misunderstanding.) Jung noted that 
this process had three effects 


The first effect is that the range of consciousness is 
increased by the inclusion of a great number and variety of 
unconscious contents. The second is a gradual diminution 
of the dominating influence of the unconscious. The third 
isan alteration inthe personality.* 


After one had achieved the integration of the anima, one 
was confronted with another figure, namely the “mana personality.” 
Jung argued that when the anima lost her “mana” or power, the 
man who assimilated it must have acquired this, and so became 
“mana personality” a being of superior will and wisdom. However, 
this figure was ‘a dominant of the collective unconscious, the 
recognized archetype of the powerful man in the form of hero, 
chief, magician, medicine man, and saint, the lord of men and 
spirits, the friend of Gods» Thus in integrating the anima, and 
attaining her power, one inevitably identified with the figure of 
the magician, and one faced the task of differentiating oneself 
from this, He added that for women, the corresponding figure 
wwas that of the Great Mother. If one gave up the claim to victory 
over the anima, possession by the figure of the magician ceased, 
and one realized that the mana truly belonged to the “mid-point 
of the personality” namely, the self. The assimilation of the contents 
of the mana personality led to the self. Jung's description of the 
encounter with the mana personality, both the identification and 
subsequent disidentification with it, corresponds to his encounter 
with Philemon in Liber Novus. Of the self, Jung wrote: “It might 
as well be called ‘God in us.’ The beginnings of our whole psychic 
life seem to be inextricably rooted to this point, and all our 
highest and deepest purposes seem to be striving toward it.”™* 
Jung’s description of the self conveys the significance of his 
realization following his Liverpool dream: 


The self could be characterized as a kind of compensation 
for the conflict between inner and outer ... the selfis also 
the goal of life, because it is the most complete expression 
of that fateful combination we call individuality ... With 
the experiencing of the self as something irrational, as an 
indefinable being to which the I is neither opposed nor 
subjected, but in a relation of dependence, and around

which it revolves, very much as the earth revolves about the 
sun—then the goal of individuation has been reached. 


The Confrontation 
with the World 


Why did Jung stop working on Liter Novus? In his afterword, 
written in 1959, he wrote: 


My acquaintance with alchemy in 1930 took me away 
from it. The beginning of the end came in 1928, when 
[Richard] Wilhelm sent me the text of the “Golden flower,” 
an alchemical treatise, There the contents of this book found 
their way into actuality and I could no longer continue 
working on it.™* 


There is one more completed painting in Liber Novus. In 
1928, Jung painted a mandala of a golden castle (Page 163) 
‘After painting it, it struck him that the mandala had something 
Chinese about it, Shortly afterward, Richard Wilhelm sent him 
the text of The Secret of the Golden Flower, asking him to write a 
commentary on it. Jung was struck by it and the timing: 


The text gave me an undreamed-of confirmation of my 
ideas about the mandala and the citcumambulation of the 
center, This was the first event which broke through my 
isolation. I became aware of an affinity; I could establish ties 
with someone and something” 


‘The significance of this confirmation is indicated in the lines 
that he wrote beneath the painting of the Yellow Castle Jung 
was struck by the correspondences between the imagery and 
conceptions of this text and his own paintings and fantasies. On 
May 25, 1929, he wrote to Wilhelm: “Fate appears to have given 
us the role of two bridge pillars which carry the bridge between 
East and West.” Only later did he realize that the alchemical 
nature of the text was important” He worked on his commentary 
during 1929. On September 10, 1929, he wrote to Wilhelm: “I am 
thrilled by this text, which stands so close to our unconscious.”=" 

Jung’s commentary on The Secret of the Golden Flower was a 
turning point, [twas his first public discussion of the significance 
of the mandala. For the first time, Jung anonymously presented 
three of his own paintings from Liber Novus as examples of 
European mandalas, and commented on them." To Wilhelm, he 
wrote on October 28, 1929, concerning the mandalas in the volume 
“the images amplify one another precisely through their diversity 
They give an excellent image of the effort of the unconscious 
European spirit to grasp Eastern eschatology” This connection 
between the “European unconscious spirit” and Eastern escha- 
tology became one of the major themes in Jung's work in the 
1930s, which he explored through further collaborations with the

Indologists Wilhelm Hauer and Heinrich Zimmer.™ At the same 
time, the form of the work was crucial: rather than revealing the full 
details of his own experiment, or those of his patients, Jung used 
the parallels with the Chinese text as an indirect way of speaking 
about it, much as he had begun to do in chapter 5 of Psychological 
Types. This allegorical method now became his preferred form. 
Rather than write directly of his experiences, he commented on 
analogous developments in esoteric practices, and most of all 
in medieval alchemy. 

Shortly afterward, Jung abruptly left off working on Liber 
Novus. The last full-page image was left unfinished, and he 
stopped transcribing the text, He later recalled that when he 
reached this central point, or Tao, his confrontation with the 
world commenced, and he began to give many lectures.*® Thus 
the “confrontation with the unconscious” drew to a close, and 
the “confrontation with the world” began. Jung added that he 
saw these activities as a form of compensation for the years of 
inner preoccupation 


The Comparative Study 
of the Individuation Process 


Jung had been familiar with alchemical texts from around 1910. 
In 1912, Théodore Flournoy had presented a psychological 
interpretation of alchemy in his lectures at the University of 
Geneva and, in 1914, Herbert Silberer published an extensive 
work on the subject.” Jung's approach to alchemy followed 
the work of Flournoy and Silberer, in regarding alchemy from 
a psychological perspective, His understanding of it was based 
on ewo main theses: first, that in meditating on the texts and 
materials in their laboratories, the alchemists were actually 
practicing a form of active imagination. Second, that the 
symbolism in the alchemical texts corresponded to that of the 
individuation process with which Jung and his patients had 
been engaged. 

In the 1930s, Jung's activity shifted from working on his 
fantasies in the Black Books to his alchemy copy books. In these, he 
presented an encyclopedic collection of excerpts from alchemical 
literature and related works, which he indexed according to key 
words and subjects. These copy books formed the basis of his 
writings on the psychology of alchemy. 

After 1930, Jung put Liber Novus to one side. While he had 
stopped working directly on it, it still remained at the center 
of his activity. In his therapeutic work, he continued to attempt 
to foster similar developments in his patients, and to establish 
which aspects of his own experience were singular, and which 
had some generality and applicability to others. In his symbolic 
researches, Jung was interested in parallels to the imagery and 
conceptions of Liber Novus. The question that he pursued was the 
following: was something akin to the individuation process to be 
found in all cultures? If so, what were the common and differential

elements? In this perspective, Jungs work after 1930 could be 
considered as an extended amplification of the contents of Liber 
‘Novus, and an attempt to translate its contents into a form accept- 
able to the contemporary outlook. Some of the statements made 
in Liber Novus closely correspond to positions that Jung would 
later articulate in his published works, and represent their first 
formulations. On the other hand, much did not directly find 
its way into the Collected Works, or was presented in a schematic 
form, or through allegory and indirect allusion. Thus Liber Novus 
enables a hitherto unsuspected clarification of the most difficult 
aspects of Jung's Collected Works, One is simply not ina position to 
comprehend the genesis of Jung's late work, nor to fully under- 
stand what he was attempting to achieve, without studying Liber 
Novus. At the same time, the Collected Works can in part be 
considered an indirect commentary on Liber Novus. Each mutually 
explicates the other 

Jung saw his “confrontation with the unconscious” as the source 
of his later work. He recalled that all his work and everything 
that he subsequently achieved came from these imaginings. He 
had expressed things as well as he was able, in clumsy, handi- 
capped language. He often felt as if “gigantic blocks of stone 
were tumbling down upon [him]. One thunderstorm followed 
another.” He was amazed it hadn't broken him as it had done 
others, such as Schreber” 

When asked by Kurt Wolff in 1957 on the relation between 
his scholarly works and his biographical notes of dreams and 
fantasies, Jung replied: 


That was the primal stuff that compelled me to work on it, 
and my work is a more or less successful attempt to incorporate 
this incandescent matter into the worldview of my time, 
The first imaginings and dreams were like fiery, molten 
basalt, from which the stone crystallized, upon which I 
could work."° 


He added that “it has cost me 45 years so to speak, to bring the 
things that I once experienced and wrote down into the vessel of 
my scientific work." 

In Jung's own terms, Liber Novus could be considered to 
contain, among other things, an account of stages of his process 
of individuation, In subsequent works, he tried to point out 
the general schematic common elements to which he could find 
parallels in his patients and in comparative research, The later 
‘works thus present a skeletal outline, a basic sketch, but left out 
the main body of detail. In retrospect, he described the Red Book 
asan attempt to formulate things in terms of revelation. He had 
hope that this would feee him, but found that it didn’t. He then 
realized that he had to return to the human side and to science. He 
had to draw conclusions from the insights. The elaboration of 
the material in the Red Book was vital, but he also had to under- 
stand the ethical obligations. In doing so, he had paid with his 
life and his science.

220 | LIBER NOVUS 


In 1930, he commenced a series of seminars on the fantasy 
visions of Christiana Morgan at the Psychological Club in Ziirich, 
which can in part be regarded as an indirect commentary on 
Liber Novus To demonstzate the empirical validity of the concep- 
tions that he derived in the latter, he had to show that processes 
depicted within it were not unique. 

‘With his seminars on Kundalini Yoga in 1932, Jung commenced 
a comparative study of esoteric practices, focusing on the spiritual 
exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, Patanjali’s Yoga sutras, Buddhist 
meditational practices, and medieval alchemy, which he presented 
in an extensive series of lectures at the Swiss Federal Institute 
of Technology (ETH).** The critical insight that enabled these 
linkages and comparisons was Jung's realization that these 
practices were all based on different forms of active imagina- 
tion—and that they all had as their goal the transformation of 
the personality—which Jung understood as the process of 
individuation. Thus Jung’s ETH lectures provide a comparative 
history of active imagination, the practice that formed the basis 
of Liber Novus 

In 1934, he published his first extended case description of 
the individuation process, which was that of Kristine Mann, 
who had painted an extensive series of mandalas. He referred 
to his own undertaking. 


T have naturally used this method on myself too and can 
affirm that one can paint very complicated pictures without 
having the least idea of their real meaning. While painting 
them, the picture seems to develop out of itself and often 
in opposition to one’s conscious intentions. 


He noted that the present work filled a gap in his description 
of his therapeutic methods, as he had written little about active 
imagination, He had used this method since 1916, but only 
sketched it in The Relations of the I to the Unconscious in 1928, and 
first mentioned the mandala in 1929, in his commentary on The 
Secret of the Golden Flower: 


For at least thirteen years I kept quiet about the results 
of these methods in order to avoid any suggestion. I wanted 
to assure myself that these things—mandalas especially — 
really are produced spontaneously and were not suggested 
to the patient by my own fantasy 


‘Through his historical studies, he convinced himself that mandalas 
had been produced in all times and places. He also noted that 
they were produced by patients of psychotherapists who were 
not his students. This also indicates one consideration that may 
have led him not to publish Liber Novus: to convince himself, and 
his critics, that the developments of his patients and especially 
their mandala images were not simply due to suggestion. He 
held that the mandala represented one of the best examples of 
the universality of an archetype. In 1936, he also noted that he 
himself had used the method of active imagination over a long 
period of time, and observed many symbols that he had been 
able to verify only years later in texts that had been unknown 
to him. However, from an evidential standpoint, given the 
breadth of his learning, Jung's own material would not have 


been a particularly convincing example of his thesis that images 
from the collective unconscious spontaneously emerged without 
prior acquaintance. 

In Liber Novus, Jung articulated his understanding of the 
historical transformations of Christianity, and the historicity 
of symbolic formations, He took up this theme in his writings on 
the psychology of alchemy and on the psychology of Christian 
dogmas, and most of all in Answer to Job, As we have seen, it was 
Jung’s view that his prewar visions were prophetic that led to 
the composition of Liber Novus. In 1952, through his collabora~ 
tion with the Nobel prize-winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli, 
Jung argued that there existed a principle of acausal orderedness 
that underlay such “meaningful coincidences,” which he called 
synchronicity” He claimed that under certain circumstances, 
the constellation of an archetype led to a relativization of time 
and space, which explained how such events could happen. 
This was an attempt to expand scientific understanding to 
accommodate events such as his visions of 1913 and 1914. 

It is important to note that the relation of Liber Novus to 
Jungs scholarly writings did not follow a straight point-by- 
point translation and elaboration. As early as 1916, Jung sought to 
convey some of the results of his experiments in a scholarly 
language, while continuing with the elaboration of his fantasies 
One would do best to regard Liber Novus and the Black Books as 
representing a private opus that ran parallel to and alongside 
his public scholarly opus; whilst the latter was nourished by 
and drew from the former, they remained distinct. After ceasing 
to work on Liber Novus, he continued to elaborate his private 
copus—his own mythology—in his work on the tower, and in 
his stone carvings and paintings. Here, Liber Novus functioned 
as a generating center, and a number of his paintings and 
carvings relate to it. In psychotherapy, Jung sought to enable 
his patients to recover a sense of meaning in life through 
facilitating and supervising their own self-experimentation and 
symbol creation. At the same time, he attempted to elaborate a 
general scientific psychology. 


The Publication 
of Liber Novus 


While Jung had stopped working directly on Liber Novus, the 
question of what to do with it remained, and the issue of its 
eventual publication remained open. On April 10, 1942, Jung 
replied to Mary Mellon concerning a printing of the Sermons: 
“Concerning the printing of the ‘Seven Sermones’ I should 
wish you to wait for awhile. I had in mind to add certain material, 
but I have hesitated for years to do it, But at such an occasion 
one might risk it.” In 1944, he had a major heart attack and 
did not see this plan through. 

In 1952, Lucy Heyer put forward a project for a biography of 
Jung. At Olga Froebe's suggestion and on Jung's insistence, 
Cary Baynes began collaborating with Lucy Heyer on this project. 
Cary Baynes considered writing a biography of Jung based on Liber 
Novus*® To Jung's disappointment, she withdrew from the project. 
After several years of interviews with Lucy Heyer, Jung terminated 
her biographical project in 1955, because he was dissatisfied with

her progress. In 1956, Kurt Wolff proposed another biographical 
project, which became Memories, Dreams, Reflections. At some stage, 
Jung gave Aniela Jaffé a copy of the draft of Liber Novus, which had 
been made by Toni Wolff. Jung authorized Jaffé to cite from Liber 
Novus and the Black Books in Memories, Dreams, Reffections>® In his 
interviews with Aniela Jaffé, Jung discussed Liber Novus and his 
self-experimentation. Unfortunately, she did not reproduce all 
his comments. 

‘On October 31, 1957, she wrote to Jack Barrett of the Bollingen 
Foundation concerning Liber Novus, and informed him that Jung 
hhad suggested that it and the Black Books be given to the library of 
the University of Basel with a restriction of 50 years, 80 years, or 
longer, as “he hates the idea that anybody should read this material 
without knowing the relations to his life, etc.” She added that she had. 
decided not to use much of this material in Memories.® In one early 
manuscript of Memories, Jaffé had included a transcription of 
the draft typescript of most of Liber Primus.® But it was omitted 
from the final manuscript, and she did not cite from Liber Novus 
or the Black Books. In the German edition of Memories, Jaffé 
included Jung's epilogue to Liber Novus as an appendix. Jung’s 
flexible date stipulations concerning access to Liber Novus were 
similar to that which he gave around the same time concerning 
the publication of his correspondence with Freud” 

On October 12, 1957, Jung told Jaffé that he had never finished 
the Red Book: According to Jaffé, in the spring of the year 1959 
Jung, after a time of lengthy ill-health, took up Liber Novus again, to 
complete the last remaining unfinished image. Once again, he 
took up the transcription of the manuscript into the calligraphic 
volume. Jaffé notes, “However, he still could not or would not 
complete it. He told me that it had to do with death.”** The cal- 
ligraphic transcription breaks off midsentence, and Jung added 
an afterword, which also broke off midsentence. The postscript 
and Jung’s discussions of its donation to an archive suggest that 
Jung was aware that the work would eventually be studied at 
some stage. After Jung's death, Liber Novus remained with his 
family, in accordance with his will. 

In her 1971 Eranos lecture, “The creative phases in Jung’ life,” 
Jaffé cited two passages from the draft of Liber Novus, noting that 
“Jung placed a copy of the manuscript at my disposal with permission 
to quote from it as occasion arose.” This was the only time she did 
so. Pictures from Liber Novus were also shown in a BBC documen- 
tary on Jung narrated by Laurens van der Post in 1972. These 
created widespread interest in it. In 1975, after the much acclaimed 
publication of The Freud/Jung Letters, William McGuire, representing

INTRODUCTION | 221 


Princeton University Press, wrote to the lawyer of the Jung estate, 
Hans Karrer, with a publication proposal for Liber Novus and a 
collection of photographs of Jung's stone carvings, paintings, 
and the tower. He proposed a facsimile edition, possibly with- 
out the text. He wrote that “we are uninformed of the number 
of its pages, the relative amount of text and pictures, and the 
content and interest of the text." No one in the press had 
actually seen or read the work or knew much about it. This 
request was denied. 

In 1975, some reproductions from the calligraphic volume 
of Liber Novus were displayed at an exhibition commemorating 
Jung's centenary in Ziirich. In 1977, nine paintings from Liber 
Novus were published by Jaffé in C. G. Jung: Word and Image and 
in 1989 a few other related paintings were published by Gerhard 
‘Wehr in his illustrated biography of Jung."* 

In 1984, Liber Novus was professionally photographed, and 
five facsimile editions were prepared. These were given to the five 
families directly descendent from Jung. In 1992, Jung's family, 
who had supported the publication of Jung's Collected Works 
in German (completed in 1995), commenced an examination 
of Jung's unpublished materials. As a result of my researches, 
TI found one transcription and a partial transcription of Liber 
‘Novus and presented them to the Jung heirs in 1997. Around the 
same time, another transcription was presented to the heirs 
by Marie-Louise von Franz. I was invited to present reports 
on the subject and its suitability for publication, and made a 
presentation on the subject. On the basis of these reports and 
discussions, the heirs decided in May 2000 to release the work 
for publication 

The work on Liber Novus was at the center of Jung's 
self-experimentation. It is nothing less than the central book in 
his oeuvre. With its publication, one is now in a position to study 
what took place there on the basis of primary documentation as 
opposed to the fantasy, gossip, and speculation that makes up 
100 much of what is written on Jung, and to grasp the genesis 
and constitution of Jung's later work. For nearly a century, such 
a reading has simply not been possible, and the vast literature on 
Jung's life and work that has arisen has lacked access to the single 
most important documentary source. This publication marks 
a caesura, and opens the possibility of a new era in the under~ 
standing of Jung's work. It provides a unique window into how 
he recovered his soul and, in so doing, constituted a psychology. 
Thus this introduction does not end with a conclusion, but with 
the promise of a new beginning,

Translators’ Note 


MARK KYBURZ, JOHN PECK, AND SONU SHAMDASANI 
At the outset of Liber Novus, Jung experiences a crisis of language. 
‘The spirit of the depths, who immediately challenges Jung's use 
of language along with the spirit of the time, informs Jung that 
on the terrain of his soul his achieved language will no longer 
serve. His own powers of knowing and speaking can no longer 
account for why he utters what he says or under what compulsion 
he speaks. All such attempts become arbitrary in the depth realm, 
even murderous, He is made to understand that what he might 
say on these occasions is both “madness” and, instructively, what 
is! Indeed, in a broader perspective, the language that he will find 
for his inner experience would compose a vast Commedia: “Do 
you believe, man of this time, that laughter is lower than worship? 
‘Where is your measure, false measuret? The sum of life decides in 
laughter and in worship, not your judgment 

In translating this accumulated record of Jung's imaginal 
encounters with his inner figures, from a sixteen-year period 
beginning just before the First World War, we have let Jung 
remain a man who was pulled loose from his moorings but also 
caught up in the maelstrom that has gone by the name of literary 
modernism, We have tried neither to further modernize nor to 
render more archaic the language and forms in which he couched 
his personal record. 

“The language in Liber Novus pursues three main stylistic 
registers, and each poses distinct difficulties for a translator. One 
of them faithfully reports the fantasies and inner dialogues of Jung’s 
imaginal encounters, while a second remains firmly and discern 
ingly conceptual. Stilla third writes in a mantic and prophetic, or 
Romantic and dithyrambic, mode. The relation between these 
reportorial, reflective, and Romantic aspects of Jung's language 
remains comedic in a manner that Dante or Goethe would have 
recognized. That is, within each chapter the descriptive, conceptual, 
and mantic registers consistently rub against each other, while 
at the same time no single register is affected by its partners. 
All three stylistic registers serve psychic promptings, and each 
chapter shares a polyphonic mode with the others. In the 
Serutinies section from 1917 this polyphony matures, its voices 
commingling in various ratios 

A reader will quickly infer that this design was not premeditated, 
but rather grew from the experiment to which Jung arduously 
submitted. The “Editorial Note” diagrams the textual evolution 
of this composition. Here we need only observe that Jung each 
time sets down an initial protocol layer of narrative encounter, 
usually with dialogue, and then, in the “second layer,” a lyrical 
elaboration of and commentary on that encounter. The first layer 
avoids an elevated tone, whereas the second welcomes elevation 
and modulates into sermonic, mantic-prophetic reflections on the 
episode's meaning, which in turn unpack events discursively. This 
mode of composition—which is unique in Jung's works—was no 
temperamental arrangement. Instead, as the episodes accumulated 
and their stakes mounted, it grew into an experiment that was 
as much literary as it was psychological and spiritual. In Jung's 
extensive published and unpublished corpus, there is no other 
text that was subjected to such careful and continual linguistic 
revision as Liber Novus 





1 See below, p 230. 
2 See below p.230, 


These three linguistic registers already present themselves as 
virtual models for a possible translation, Our practice has been 
to let them cohabit within the exploratory frameworks alive in 
Jung's own day. The task before him was to find a language rather 
than use one ready at hand. The mantic and conceptual registers 
can themselves be considered as translations of the descriptive 
register. That is, these registers move from a literal level to symbolic 
ones that amplify it, in a modern analogue to Dante’s “modi diversi” 
in his letter to Can Grande della Scala? In a very real sense, Liber 
‘Novus was composed through intertextual translation, The book’s 
rhetoric, its manner of address, emerges from this interanimating 
structure of internal translation or transvaluation. A critical task for 
any translation of the work, therefore, is conveying this compositional 
texture intact 

“The fact that painted images of an accomplished and hybrid 
kind illuminate the medieval format of a folio in seribal hand 
compounds any reflections on the linguistic task. The novel language 
required a renewed ancient script. A polyphonic style couches itself 
multimedia fashion within a symbolic throwback-yet-forward 
movement, medieval and anticipatory, into retrievals of psychic 
reality, Verbal and visual images press in on Jung from the root 
past and present while aiming toward the beyond: a layered 
medium emerges, whose polyphonic style mirrors within its 
language that same composite layering. 

Faced with the task of translating a text composed nearly a 
hundred years ago, translators usually have the benefit of prior 
models to consult, as well as decades of scholarly commentary and 
criticism, Without such exemplars at hand, we were left to imagine 
hhow the work might have been translated in previous decades 
Consequently, our translation sidesteps several unpublished or 
hypothetical models for rendering Liber Novus into English, There 
is Peter Baynes’ strikingly archaizing Septem Sermones of 1925, 
which draws largely upon a Victorian idiom, Or the conceptu- 
ally rationalizing version that REC, Hull might have attempted 
had he been allowed to translate it alongside his other volumes 
in the Bollingen Series of Jung's Collected Works* or the elegant 
literary rendering from the hand of someone like R. J. Hollingdale. 
Our version therefore occupies an actual position in a largely 
vireual sequence. Consideration of these virtual models highlighted 
questions of how to pitch the language within historical shifts 
in English prose, how to convey the myriad convergences and 
divergences between the language of Liber Novus and Jung's 
Collected Works, and how to render in English a work simultaneously 
echoing Luther’s German and Nietzsche's parody of the same in 
Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Because our version takes this position, 
accordingly when we have cited Jung's Collected Works we have 
freshly rendered or discreetly modified the published translations, 

Liber Novus was coeval with the literary ferment that Mikhail 
Bakhtin called the dialogical prose imagination,’ The Anglo-Welsh 
writer and artist David Jones, author of In Parenthesis and The 
Anathemata, referred to the rupture of the First World War, and 
its effects on the historical sense of writers, artists, and thinkers, 
simply as “The Break.” In concert with other experimental writing 
from these decades, Liber Novus excavates archaeological layers of 
literary adventure, with hard-won consciousness as both shovel and 
precious shard, While Jung actively considered publishing Liber 
Novus for many years, he chose not to make a name for himself in

this literary manner—as much for style as for content—by releasing it 
By 1921 with Psychological Types he already found that his sanctum 
could furnish him his main themes, through translation into a 
scholarly idiom. 

Jung enunciates the tension among his three stylistic registers, 
already addressing a future readership—which shifts from an 
inner circle of friends to a wider public between different layers 
of the text. This is graphically apparent in the frequent pronomial 
shifts between the versions, which show the manner in which 
he was constantly reimagining the potential readers of the text. 
Jung coherently adopted this dialogical stance—polyphonic in 
Bakhtin’s later terms—once again mindful of a hypothetical 
future audience yet also aloof from the question of audience 
altogether, not from pride but simply in view of the aims to be 
served. Paintings and fantasies from this private treasury entered 
anonymously as crypted intertexts into Jung’ later work, nestling 
as hermetic clues to the undisclosed whole of his effort 

Indeed, we can imagine Jung laughing when he wrote of 
"3, Case Z” in the last section of his essay on “The Psychological 
Aspects of the Kore” (1941)? There he summarizes as anonymous 
twelve episodes from encounters with his own soul in Liber Novas, 
calling them “a dream-series.” The comments he appends to 
these propel the adventurer he had been, and the subject he 
became in that adventure, into the discourse of a would-be science. 
The comedy is both spacious and exquisite: this respectful host 
to the anima also wields the diagnostic pointer in all seriousness. 
His language flexibly straddled both contexts, but also kept 
certain veils in place while doing so. This linguistic strategy 
mirrored Jung's larger aims in remaining fruitfully dual and 
contextual, Declaring his mysteries to be particular, not to be 
aped in any way, he nonetheless also offered them as a template 
of formative spiritual process, and, in so doing, attempted to 
develop an idiom that could be taken up by others to articulate 
their experiences. 

This is one way of paraphrasing the considerable anomaly of 
the language that Jung had to find through sleepless nights from 
1913 onward. That language shifted its shape, altered its scale, 
and weighed both megrims and tons. Therefore it comes as 
no surprise that in his more elevated passages Jung relied on 
the resonance of the Luther Bible, itself a translation that had 
achieved rocklike stability within German culture, Ef feste Burg, 
“a mighty fortress:” thus our own reliance here on the King James 
Version of the Bible (kjv) for comparable tonalities in English. 
Yet a paradox rises immediately: what Jung counted on in that 
resonance had transplanted an alien spirit into the Germanic 
‘Heimat or home, as one may likewise say of the kjv’s deep embed- 
ding of the same implantin Anglo-Saxon culture. Franz Rosenzweig, 
translating parts of the Old Testament with Martin Buber in the 
mid-1920s, identified Luther’s Bible as the great space-maker 
within Germanic spirit, precisely through Luther's close-in moves

TRANSLATORS’ NOTE | 223 


‘toward his source: “For the comfort of our souls, we must retain 
such words, must put up with them, and so give the Hebrew 
some room where it does better than German can.”* Thus our 
own practice of not smoothing out Jung's several modes, or 
making them run more fluently than need be, or even regularizing 
his punctuation. Think of Dante's “shaggy” diction, or of still 
another maxim from Luther in Rosenzweig’s notes: “The mud 
will cling to the wheel.” 

Yet even these profound allowances for archaic and original 
speech across abysses of meaning fail to approximate the 
destabilizing experience, in and through language, to which Jung 
testifies, His later comments in the published memoir, on his 
reservations about high-flown style,” in effect cover his tracks in 
Liber Novus. The original experience sent speech into a spin that 
animates the book's initiatic dimension. Language too undergoes 
a descent into hell and the realm of the dead, which divests one 
of speech even as it renews the capacity for utterance. 

‘The following instances give some idea of this factor’s range, 
mapping the stresses in any sincere ventriloquism such as Jung 
risked by undertaking a controlled séance with himself and his 
ground, with pen in hand, Hélderlin’s hair-breadth space warps 
and Isaiah's tongue-borne burning coal both move in this league, 
along with Plato on “right frenzy” or divine madness: (1)° My soul 
spoke to me in a whisper, urgently and alarmingly: ‘Words, words, 
do not make too many words, Be silent and listen: have you 
recognized your madness, and do you admit it? Have you noticed 
that all your foundations are all completely mired in madness? *™ 
(2) Jung's soul: “There are hellish webs of words, only words 
Be tentative with words, value them... for you are the first who 
gets snared in them, For words have meanings. With words you 
pull up the underworld, Word, the paltriest and the mightiest. 
In words the emptiness and the fullness flow together. Hence 
the word is an image of the God."* (3) “But if the word is a 
symbol, it means everything. When the way enters death and 
‘we are surrounded by rot and horror, the way rises in the dark- 
ness and leaves the mouth as the saving symbol, the word.”” (4) 
The dead woman: “Let me have the word—oh, that you cannot 
hear! How difficult—give me the word!” It then materializes in 
Jung's hand as HAP, the phallus. (5) Jung's soul: “You possess the 
word that should not be allowed to remain concealed.”* (6) Jung 
“What is my word? Itis the stammering of a minor...” Soul: “They 
do not see the fire, they do not believe your words, but they see 
your mark and unknowingly suspect you to be the messenger of 
the burning agony... .You stutter, you stammer” In the protocols 
for his memoir, Jung recalls bringing to the original experiences 
in Liber Novus only a “highly clumsy speech.”” Yet one instance 
(9) strongly belies that later emphasis: “I knew that Philemon 
had intoxicated me and given me a language that was foreign to 
me and of a different sensitivity. All of this faded when the God 
arose and only Philemon kept that language.”*

This last instance indicates that Jung later attributed the 
‘mantic, dithyrambic speech of layer two in everything before the 
Scrutinies section to Philemon. The literal intoxication described 
here is linguistic, a dramatized, ventriloquial version of Platonic 
divine madness. Ie therefore underscores our attempt to faithfully 
render the stylistic registers of Liber Novus so as to present a 
vital aspect of Jung’s literary experiment, as he grapples with 
attempting to find the most fitting idiom in which to cast the 
transformations of inner experience. Jung's search for the soul, 
then, stands at one with the search for appropriately dialogical 
and differentiated language 

‘These instances in all their oscillations affect a reading of 
Jung’s Collected Works, and counsel caution with applying its 
conceptual tools to the task of reading and understanding Liber 
Novus. To take but one example, one begins to see that it is too 
neat to equate the opposed yet related depths of Logos and Eros 
with the conceptual and lyrical-mantic registers found in Liber 
Novus, Jung’s “Commentary” on the Flijah-Salome relation: 
ship included here shows that relationship to be developmental, a 
mystery play of “the formative process” that kindles love for the 
lowest in us.” The modal span for language in Liber Novus thus 
animates that mystery play but does not correspond disectly to 
opposed psychological functions. 


19 See Appendix B, 
20 MP. p. 183, 


This complex respect for language instructs translators of 
Liber Novus in navigating the underworld/redemptive tensions 
spanned by its rhetoric. The great force behind the mantic tension in 
that rhetoric occupied Jung in the brief Epilogue he inscribed 
in the calligraphic volume in 1959, two years before his death. 
Once again plying the seas of those illuminated pages, he seems to 
have found any further summing-up to be unnecessary. Breaking 
off'in midsentence, he left the book to stand on its own, as one strand 
of discourse within his whole effort. That counterpoint required 
no comment, any more than did the three registers of language 
within the book itself Ordeal was Commedia afterall, calling for no 
retrospective theoretical justification. Liber Novus would survive 
the gropings and peltings of reception. Jung had remarked in 
1957 to Aniela Jafié that so much rubbish had been said about 
him, that any more didn’t disturb him2® That lifted pen therefore 
confidently consigned the book to its depth trajectory, steeply 
expanding into the quarry it had become, with both his Collected 
Works and the lakeside tower at Bollingen as its final extractions, 

In this note we have attempted to convey only the general 
principles that have guided this translation. A full discussion of 
the choices that confronted us and a justification of the decisions 
taken would fill a volume as ample as this one. 


Editorial Note 


SONU SHAMDASANI 
Liber Novus is an unfinished manuscript corpus, and it is not 
completely clear how Jung intended to complete it, or how he 
would have published it, had he decided to do so. We have a 
series of manuscripts, of which no single version can be taken 
2s final. Consequently, the text could be presented in a variety of 
ways. This note indicates the editorial rationale behind the present 
edition, 

he following is the sequence of extant manuscripts for Liber 
Primus and Liber Secundus: 





Black Books 2-5 (November 1913~April 1914) 
Handwritten Draft (Summer 1914-1915) 

Typed Draft (circa 1918) 

Corrected Draft (with one layer of changes circa 1915 
one layer of changes circa mid-1920s) 

Calligraphic Volume (1915-1930, resumed in 1959, 
left incomplete) 

Cary Baynes's transcription (1924-1925) 

Yale Manuscript. Liber Primus, minus the prologue 
(identical with Typed Draft) 

Copy-Edited Draft of Liber Primus minus the prologue, 
with corrections in unknown hands (circa late 1950s; 
edited version of the Typed Drafi) 


For Serutinies, we have: 


Black Books 5~6 (April 1914~June 1916) 

Calligraphic Septem Sermones (1916) 

Printed Septem Sermones (1916) 

Handwritten Draft (circa 1917) 

Typed Draft (circa 1918) 

Cary Baynes’ transcription (1925) (27 pages, incomplete) 


The arrangement presented here starts with a revision of Cary 
Baynes’s transcription and a fresh transcription of the remain- 
ing material in the calligraphic volume together with the Typed 
Draft of Scrutinies, with line-by-line comparisons with all extant 
versions. The last thirty pages are completed from the Draft. The 
main variations between the different manuscripts concern the 
“second layer” of the text. These changes represent Jung’s continued 
work of comprehending the psychological significance of the 
fantasies. As Jung considered Liber Novus to be an “attempt at an 
claboration in terms of the revelation.” the changes between the 
different versions present this “attempt at an elaboration,” and 
therefore are an important part of the work itself, Thus che 
notes indicate significant changes between the different ver- 
sions, and they present material chat clarifies the meaning or 
context of a particular section. Each manuscript layer is impor- 
tant and interesting, and a publication of all of them—which 
would run to several thousand pages—would be a task for the 
future’ 

The criterion for including passages from the earlier 
manuscripts has been simply the question: does this inclusion 
help the reader comprehend what is taking place? Aside from 
the intrinsic importance of these changes, noting them in the 
footnotes serves a second purpose—it shows how carefully Jung 
worked at continually revising the text. 





EDITORIAL NOTE | 225 


“The Corrected Draft has two layers of corrections by Jung. The 
first set of corrections appears to have been done after the Draft 
‘was typed and before the transcription into the calligraphic 
volume, as it appears that it was this manuscript that Jung 
transcribed A further set of corrections on approximately 
200 pages of the typescript appears to have been made afier 
the calligraphic volume, and I would estimate that these were 
done sometime in the mid-1920s. These corrections modernize 
the language, and bring the terminology into relation with Jung's 
terminology from the period of Psychological Types. Additional 
clarifications are also added. Jung even corrected material in 
the Draft that was deleted in the calligraphic volume. I have 
presented some of the significant changes in the footnotes 
From them, it is possible for a reader to see how Jung would 
have revised the whole text, had he completed this layer of cor- 
rections, 

Subdivisions have been added in Liber Secundus, chapter 21, 
“The Magician,” and in Scrutinies for ease of reference. These are 
indicated by numbers in scrolled brackets: { }. Where possible, 
the date of each fantasy has been given from the Black Books. The 
second layer added in the draft is indicated by [2], and the 
manuscript reverts to the sequence of the fantasies in the Black 
Books at the beginning of the following chapter. In the pas- 
sages where subdivisions have been added, the reversion to the 
sequence of the Black Books is indicated by [1] 

‘The various manuscripts have different systems of 
paragraphing. In the Drafi, paragraphs often consist of one or 
‘ovo sentences, and the text is presented like a prose poem. 
Ac the other extreme, in the calligraphic volume, there are 
lengthy passages of text with no paragraph breaks. The most 
logical paragraphing appears in Cary Baynes's transcription. 
She frequently took her cue for paragraph breaks from the 
presence of colored initials. Because it is unlikely that she 
‘would have reparagraphed the text without Jung's approval, her 
layout has formed the point of departure for this edition. In some 
instances, the paragraphing has been brought closer into line 
with the Draft and the calligraphic volume. In the second half 
of her transcription, Cary Baynes transcribed the Drafi, because 
the calligraphic volume had not been completed. Here, I have 
parageaphed the text in the same manner as established before. 
1 believe that this presents the text in the clearest and easiest- 
to-follow form. 

In the calligraphic volume, Jung illustrated certain initials 
and wrote some in red and blue, and sometimes increased the 
font of the text. The layout here attempts to follow these 
conventions, Because the initials in question aren't always the 
same in English and German, the choice of which initial to set 
in red in the English has been governed by its corresponding 
location in the text, The bolding and increase of font size has 
been rendered by italics, The remainder of the text beyond that 
which Jung transcribed in the calligraphic volume has been set 
following the same conventions, to maintain consistency. In the 
case of the Septem Sermones, the font coloring has followed Jung's 
printed version of 1916, 

The decision to include Scrutinies in sequence with and as 
part of Liber Novus is based on the following editorial rationale: 
‘The material in the Black Books commences in November 1913 
Liber Secundus closes with material from April 19, 1914, and 
Scrutinies commences with material from the same day. The Black 
Books run consecutively until July 21, 1914, and recommence on 


+ Interested readers may compare this edition withthe sections from the Draft in the Kure Wolff papers at Yale University and with Cary Baynes's transcription 
atthe Contemporary Medical Archives at the Welleome Collection, London, It is quite possible that other manuscripts may yet come fo light

226 | LIBER Novus 


June 3, 1915. In the hiatus, Jung wrote the Handwritten Draft 
‘When Cary Baynes transcribed Liber Norus between 1924 
and 1925, the first half of her transcription followed Liber Novus 
itself to the point reached by Jung in his own transcription into 
the calligraphic volume. It continues by following the draft, and 
then proceeds 27 pages into Scrutinies, ending midsentence 

‘At the end of Liber Secundus, Jung’s soul has ascended 
to Heaven following the reborn God, Jung now thinks that 
Philemon is a charlatan, and comes to his “I.” whom he must live 
with and educate, Serutinies continues directly from this point 
with a confrontation with his “I.” The ascent of the reborn 
God is referred to, and his soul returns and explains why she 
had disappeared. Philemon reappears, and instructs Jung on 
how to establish the right relation to his soul, the dead, the 
Gods, and the daimons. In Serutinies Philemon fully emerges and 
takes on the significance that Jung attached to him both in 
the 1925 seminar and in Memories. Only in Scrutinies do certain 
episodes in Liber Primus and Liber Secundus become clear, By the 
same token, the narrative in Serutinies makes no sense if one has 
not read Liber Primus and Liber Secundus 

‘At two places in Scrutinies, Liber Primus and Liber Secundus are 
mentioned in a way that strongly suggests that they are all part of 
the same work: 


And then the War broke out. This opened my eyes about 
what T had experienced before and it also gave me the 
courage to say all that I have written in the earlier part of 
this book? 


Since the God has ascended to the upper realms, 6IAHMON 
has also become different. He first appeared to me as a 
magician who lived in a distant land, but then I felt his 
nearness and, since the God has ascended, I knew that 


3 See below. p 336

SUA 
6JA 


IAHMON had intoxicated me and given me a language 
that was foreign to me and of a different sensitivity. All of 
this faded when the God arose and only @1AHMON kept 
that language. But I felt chat he went on other ways than I 
did, Probably the greater part of what I have written in the 
earlier part of this book was given to me by @1AHMQN: 


These references to the “earlier part of this book” suggest that 
all of this indeed constitutes one book, and that Scrutines was 
considered by Jung to be part of Liber Novus. 

This view is supported by the number of internal connections 
between the texts, One example is the fact that the mandalas in 
Liber Novus are closely connected to the experience of the self and 
the realization of its centrality depicted only in Serutinis. Another 
example occurs in Liber Secundus, chapter 15; when Ezechiel and 
his fellow Anabaptists arrive, they tell Jung that they are going 
to Jerusalem's holy places because they are not at peace, not 
having fully finished with life. In Scrutinies, the dead reappear, 
telling Jung that they have been to Jerusalem, but did not find 
what they sought there. At that point, Philemon appears and 
the Septem Sermones begin. Perhaps Jung intended to transcribe 
Scrutinies into the calligraphic volume and illustrate it; there are 
ample blank pages. 

On January 8, 1958, Cary Baynes asked Jung: “Do you remember 
that you had me copy quite a bit of the Red Book itself while 
you were in Africa? I got as far as the beginning of the Prifungen 
[Scruténies]. This goes beyond what Frau Jaffé put at K, W's [Kurt 
Wolff] disposal and he would like to read it, Is that OK?" Jung 
replied on January 24, “I have no objections against your lending 
your notes of the ‘Red Book’ to Mr. Wolf Here Cary Baynes, 00, 
seems to have regarded Scrutinis as part of Liber Novus

/ (HI i@)] [2] IF speak in the spirit of this time’ I must say: 
no one and nothing can justify what I must proclaim to you 
Justification is superfluous to me, since I have no choice, but I 
must. I have learned that in addition to the spirit of this time 
there is still another spirit at work, namely that which rules the 
depths of everything contemporary The spirit of this time would 
like to hear of use and value. I also thought this way, and my 
humanity still thinks this way. But that other spirit forces me 
nevertheless to speak, beyond justification, use, and meaning 
Filled with human pride and blinded by the presumptuous spirit 
of the times, I long sought to hold that other spirit away from 
me, But I did not consider that the spirit of the depths from 
time immemorial and for al the future possesses a greater power 
than the spirit of this time, who changes with the generations. 
The spirit of the depths has subjugated all pride and arrogance to 
the power of judgment. He took away my belief in science, he 
robbed me of the joy of explaining and ordering things, and he let 
devotion to the ideals of this time die out in me, He forced me 
down to the last and simplest things. 

The spirit of the depths took my understanding and all my 
knowledge and placed them at the service of the inexplicable 
and the paradoxical. He robbed me of speech and writing for 
everything that was not in his service, namely the melting together 
of sense and nonsense, which produces the supreme meaning

The supreme meaning is not a meaning and not ax absurdity, ét is image 
and force in one, magnificence and force together. 

‘The supreme meaning isthe beginning ond the end, Its the bride of gong 
across and fulfillment? 

The other Gods died of their temporary, yer the supreme meaning never 
dies, it turns into meaning and then into absurdiey, and out of the fre and 
blood of their collision the supreme meaning rises up rejuvenated anew. 

The image of God has a shadow. The supreme meaning és real and cass 
shadow. For what can be actual and corporeal and have no shadow? 

The shadow i nonsense. It lacks force and has no continued existence 
through itself: But nonsense is the inseparable and undying brother of the 
supreme meaning. 

Like plants, so men also grow, some in the light, others in the shadows. 
There are many who need the shadows and not the light. 

The image of God throws a shadow that is just as great as itself 

The supreme meaning is great and small, i i as wide asthe space of the 
starry Heaven and as narrow as the cll of te living bod. 

The spirit of this time in me wanted to recognize the great- 
ness and extent of the supreme meaning, but not its littleness 
The spirit of the depths, however, conquered this arrogance, and 
Thad to swallow the small as a means of healing the immortal in 
me. It completely burnt up my innards since it was inglorious and 
unheroic. It was even ridiculous and revolting, But the pliers of 
the spirit of the depths held me, and I had to drink the bitterest 
of all draughts? 

The spirit of this time tempted me with the thought that all 
this belongs to the shadowiness of the God-image. This would 
be pernicious deception, since the shadow is nonsense. But the 
small, narrow, and banal is not nonsense, but one of both of the 
essences of the Godhead. 

1 resisted recognizing that the everyday belongs to the image 
of the Godhead, I fled this thought, I hid myself behind the 
highest and coldest stars, 

‘But the spit of the depths caught up with me, and forced the 
bitter drink between my lips. 

The spirit of this time whispered to me: “This supreme 
meaning, this image of God, this melting together of the hot 
and the cold, that is you and only you.” But the spirit of the 
depths spoke to me: “You are an image of the unending world, 
all the last mysteries of becoming and passing away live in you 
If you did not possess all this, how could you know?” 

For the sake of my human weakness, the spirit of the depths 
gave me this word, Yet this word is also superfluous, since I 
do not speak it freely, but because I must. I speak because the 
spirit robs me of joy and life if 1 do not speak" I am the serf who 
brings it and does not know what he carries in his hand, It would 
burn his hands if he did not place it where his master orders him 
tolayit. 

The spirit of our time spoke to me and said: “What dire 
urgency could be forcing you to speak all this?” This was an 
awful temptation. I wanted to ponder what inner or outer 
bind could force me into this, and because I found nothing

(Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984], 


that I could grasp, I was near to making one up. But with 
this the spisit of our time had almost brought it about that 
instead of speaking, I was thinking again about reasons and 
explanations. But the spirit of the depths spoke to me and 
said: “To understand a thing is a bridge and possibility of 
returning to the path. But to explain a matter is arbitrary and 
sometimes even murder, Have you counted the murderers 
among the scholars?” 

But the spirit of this time stepped up to me and laid before 
me huge volumes which contained all my knowledge. Their pages 
were made of ore, and a steel stylus had engraved inexorable 
words in them, and he pointed to these inexorable words and 
spoke to me, and said: “What you speak, that is madness.” 

Ieis true, itis true, what I speak is the greatness and intoxication 
and ugliness of madness. 

But the spirit of the depths stepped up to me and said: “What 
you speak is, The greatness is, the intoxication is, the undignified, 
sick, paltry dailiness is, It runs in all the streets, lives in all the 
houses, and rules the day of all humanity. Even the eternal stars 
are commonplace. Itis the great mistress and the one essence of 
God. One laughs about it, and laughter, too, is. Do you believe, 
man of this time, that laughter is lower than worship? Where is 
your measure, false measurer?? The sum of life decides in laughter 
and in worship, not your judgment.” 

I must also speak the ridiculous. You coming men! You will 
recognize the supreme meaning by the fact that he is laughter 
and worship, a bloody laughter and a bloody worship. A sacrificial 
blood binds the poles. Those who know this laugh and worship in 
the same breath, 

After this, however, my humanity approached me and said: 
“What solitude, what coldness of desolation you lay upon 
me when you speak such! Reflect on the destruction of being 
and the streams of blood from the terrible sacrifice that the 
depths demand,” 

But the spirit of the depths said: “No one can or should hale 
sacrifice, Sacrifice is not destruction, sacrifice is the foundation 
stone of what is to come. Have you not had monasteries? Have 
not countless thousands gone into the desert? You should carry 
the monastery in yourself. The desert is within you. The desert 
calls you and draws you back, and if you were fettered to the 
world of this time with iron, the call of the desert would break all 
chains, Truly, I prepare you for solitude.” 

After this, my humanity remained silent. Something happened 
to my spirit, however, which I must call mercy. 

My speech is imperfect. Not because I want to shine with 
words, but out of the impossibility of finding those words, 
I speak in images. With nothing else can I express the words 
from the depths. 

The mercy which happened to me gave me belief, hope, and 
sufficient daring, not to resist further the spirit of the depths, but 
to utter his word, But before I could pull myself together to really 
do it, I needed a visible sign that would show me that the spirit of

14 A reference to the vision that follows 


the depths in me was at the same time the ruler of the depths of 
world affairs 

“sIthappened in October of the year 1913 as I was leaving alone 
for a journey, that during the day I was suddenly overcome in 
broad daylight by a vision: I saw a terrible flood that covered all 
the northern and low-lying lands between the North Sea and the 
Allps, It reached from England up to Russia, and from the coast of 
the North Sea right up to the Alps. I saw yellow waves, swimming 
rubble, and the death of countless thousands. 

‘This vision lasted for two hours, it confused me and made me 
ill. Lwas notable to interpret it. Two weeks passed then the vision 
returned, still more violent than before, and an inner voice spoke 
“Look at it, itis completely real, and it will come to pass, You cannot 
doubt this.” I wrestled again for two hours with this vision, but it 
held me fast. It left me exhausted and confused. And I thought my 
mind had gone crazy.” 

From then on the anxiety toward the terrible event that stood, 
directly before us kept coming back. Once I also saw a sea of blood 
over the northern lands, 

In the year1914 in the month of June, atthe beginning and end of 
the month, and at the beginning of July, I had the same dream three 
times: I was in a foreign land, and suddenly, overnight and right in 
the middle of summer, a terrible cold descended from space. All seas 
and rivers were locked in ice, every green living thing had frozen. 

The second dream was thoroughly similar to this. But the third 
dream at the beginning of July went as follows: 

was in a remote English land,” Ie was necessary that I return 
to my homeland with a fast ship as speedily as possible." I reached 
home quickly” In my homeland I found that in the middle of 
summer a terrible cold had fallen from space, which had turned. 
every living thing into ice. There stood a leaf-bearing but fruit- 
less tree, whose leaves had turned into sweet grapes full of healing 
juice through the working of the frost. I picked some grapes 
and gave them to a great waiting throng” 

In reality, now, it was so: At the time when the great war 
broke out between the peoples of Europe, I found myself in 
Scotland, compelled by the war to choose the fastest ship and 
the shortest route home, I encountered the colossal cold that 
froze everything, I met up with the flood, the sea of blood, and 
found my barren tree whose leaves the frost had transformed into 
aremedy. And I plucked the ripe fruit and gave it to you and I do 
not know what I poured out for you, what bitter-swect intoxicating 
drink, which left on your tongues an aftertaste of blood. 

Believe me:" It is no teaching and no instruction that I give you. On

1 cannot tach you. The way i within us, ut no in Gods, nor i teachings, 
nor inlaws, Within us is the way, the truth, andthe life. 

Woe betide those who live by way of examples! Life is not with them. If 
you live according to an example, you thus ive the life of that example, but 
‘who should live your own if if not yourself? So live yourselves. 

The signposts have fallen, unblazed trails ie before us.** Do not be greedy 
to gobble up the fruits of foreign fields. Do you not know that you yourselves 
are the fertile acre which bears everything that avails you? 

Yet who today knows this? Who knows the way to she eternally fruigful 
climes of the soul? You seek the way through mere appearances, you study 
books and give ear to all kinds of opinion. What good i all thar? 

There és only one way and tha i your way.

‘May each go his own way: 

will be no savior, no lawgiver, no master teacher unto you. You are no

‘Giving las, wanting improvements, making things easier, es all become 
wrong and evil. May each one seek out his own way. The way leads to 
mutual love én community. Men will come to see and fel the similarity and 
commonality of their ways.

they may escape the pressure of undesirable contact, but solitude makes people 
hostile and venomous 

Therefore give people dignity and le each of them stand apart, so that each 
say find his own fellowship and love i. 

Power stands against power, contempt against contempt, love against love. 
Géve humanity dignity, and trust that life will find the better way: 

The one eye of the Godhead is blind, the one ear of the Godhead is deaf,

the world and do not overvalue its consummate beauty.”

increase of these trappings ceased, the desire ebbed from me 
and horror came over me.” The vision of the flood seized me 
and I felt the spirit of the depths, but I did not understand 
him.” Yer he drove me on with unbearable inner longing and 
I said: 


[1}" “My soul, where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call 
you—are you there? I have returned, I am here again. I have 
shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I have come 
to you, I am with you. After long years of long wandering, I 
have come to you again, Should I tell you everything I have 
seen, experienced, and drunk in? Or do you not want to heat 
about all the noise of life and the world? But one thing you 
must know: the one thing I have learned is that one must live 
this life. 

This life is the way, the long sought-after way to the 
unfathomable, which we call divine There is no other way, 
all other ways are false paths. I found the right way, it led me to 
you, to my soul. I return, tempered and purified. Do you still 
know me? How long the separation lasted! Everything has become 
so different, And how did I find you? How strange my journey 
was! What words should I use to tell you on what twisted paths 
a good star has guided me to you? Give me your hand, my almost 
forgotten soul. How warm the joy at seeing you again, you long 
disavowed soul. Life has led me back to you, Let us thank the 
life I have lived for all the happy and all the sad hours, for every 
joy, for every sadness, My soul, my journey should continue with 
you. I will wander with you and ascend to my solitude.” 

[2] The spirit of the depths forced me to say this and at the 
same time to undergo it against myself, since I had not expected 
ie then, I still labored misguidedly under the spirit of this time, 
and thought differently about the human soul. I thought and 
spoke much of the soul. I knew many learnéd words for her, I 
had judged her and turned her into a scientific object.” I did 
not consider that my soul cannot be the object of my judgment 
and knowledge; much more are my judgment and knowledge the 


52 The Handwrittor Draft has: "Dear Friende!”(p. 


1). The Draf has ‘Deat Friends!” (p. 


objects of my soul. Therefore the spirit of the depths forced me 
to speak to my soul, to call upon her as a living and self-existing 
being, I had to become aware that I had lost my soul 

From this we learn how the spirit of the depths considers the 
soul: he sees her as a living and self-existing being, and with this 
he contradicts the spirit of this time for whom the soul is a thing 
dependent on man, which lets herself be judged and arranged, 
and whose circumference we can grasp. I had to accept that what 
T had previously called my soul was not at all my soul, but a 
dead system.” Hence I had to speak to my soul as to something 
far off and unknown, which did not exist through me, but through 
whom I existed 

He whose desire turns away from outer things, reaches the 
place of the soul:® If he does not find the soul, the horror of 
emptiness will overcome him, and fear will drive him with a whip 
lashing time and again in a desperate endeavor and a blind desire 
for the hollow things of the world. He becomes a fool through 
his endless desire, and forgets the way of his soul, never to find 
her again. He will run after all things, and will seize hold of 
them, but he will not find his soul, since he would find her only 
in himself. Truly his soul lies in things and men, but the blind 
one seizes things and men, yet not his soul in things and men. He 
has no knowledge of his soul, How could he tell her apart from 
things and men? He could find his soul in desire itself, but not 
in the objects of desire. Ifhe possessed his desire, and his desire 
did not possess him, he would lay a hand on his soul, since his 
desire is the image and expression of his soul.” 

If we possess the image of a thing, we possess half the thing 

‘The image of the world is half the world. He who possesses 
the world but not its image’ possesses only half the world, since 
his soul is poor and has nothing. The wealth of the soul exists in 
images.* He who possesses the image of the world, possesses half 
the world, even if his humanity is poor and owns nothing® But 
hunger makes the soul into a beast that devours the unbearable 
and is poisoned by it, My friends, it is wise to nourish the soul, 
otherwise you will breed dragons and devils in your heart.

On the second night I called out to my soul 

“I am weary, my soul, my wandering has lasted too long, my 
search for myself outside of myself. Now I have gone through 
events and find you behind all of them. For I made discoveries 
on my erring through events, humanity, and the world. I found 
men. And you, my soul, I found again, first in images within men 
and then you yourself, I found you where I least expected you. 
You climbed out of a dark shaft. You announced yourself to me 
in advance in dreams.” They burned in my heart and drove me to 
all the boldest acts of daring, and forced me to rise above myself 
You let me see truths of which I had no previous inkling, You let 
me undertake journeys, whose endless length would have scared 
ime, if the knowledge of them had not been secure in you. 

1 wandered for many years, so long that I forgot that I 
possessed a soul* Where were you all this time? Which Beyond 
sheltered you and gave you sanctuary? Oh, that you must speak 
through me, that my speech and I are your symbol and expression! 
How should I decipher you? 

Who are you, child? My dreams have represented you as a 
child and as a maiden.” I am ignorant of your mystery'® Forgive 
me if I speak as in a dream, like a drunkard—are you God? Is God 
a child, a maiden?* Forgive me if I babble. No one else hears me. 
1 speak to you quietly, and you know that I am neither a drunkard 
nor someone deranged, and that my heart twists in pain from the 
wound, whose darkness delivers speeches full of mockery: “You 
are lying to yourself! You spoke so as to deceive others and make 
them believe in you. You want to be a prophet and chase after 
your ambition.” The wound still bleeds, and I am far from being 
able to pretend that I do not hear the mockery. 

How strange it sounds to me to call you a child, you who still 
hold the all-without-end in your hand.* I went on the way of the 
day, and you went invisibly with me, putting the pieces together 
‘meaningfully, and letting me see the whole in each part. 

You took away where I thought to take hold, and you gave me 
where I did not expect anything and time and again you brought 
about fate from new and unexpected quarters, Where I sowed, 
you robbed me of the harvest, and where I did not sow, you give 
me fruit a hundredfold, And time and again I lost the path and

found it again where I would never have foreseen it. You upheld 
my belief, when I was alone and near despair, At every decisive 
moment you let me believe in myselE.” 


[2] Like a tired wanderer who had sought nothing in the world 
apart from her, shall I come closer to my soul. I shall learn chat 
my soul finally lies behind everything, and if I cross the world, 
1 am ultimately doing this to find my soul. Even the dearest are 
themselves not the goal and end of the love that goes on seeking, 
they are symbols of their own souls. 

My friends, do you guess to what solitude we ascend? 

I must learn that the dregs of my thought, my dreams, are the 
speech of my soul. I must carry them in my heart, and go back and 
forth over them in my mind, like the words of the person dearest 
to me. Dreams are the guiding words of the soul. Why should 1 
henceforth not love my dreams and not make their riddling images 
into objects of my daily consideration? You think that the dream is 
foolish and ungainly. What is beautiful? What is ungainly? What 
is clever? What is foolish? The spirit of this time is your measure, 
but the spirit of the depths surpasses it at both ends. Only the 
spirit of this time knows the difference between large and small 
But this difference is invalid, like the spirit which recognizes it. / 


‘The spirit of the depths even taught me to consider my action 
and my decision as dependent on dreams. Dreams pave the way 
for life, and they determine you without you understanding their 
Ianguage.® One would like to learn this language, but who can 
teach and learn it? Scholarliness alone is not enough; there is a 
knowledge of the heart that gives deeper insight. The knowledge 
of the heart is in no book and is not to be found in the mouth 
of any teaches, but grows out of you like the green seed from the 
dark earth. Scholarliness belongs to the spirit of this time, but 
this spirit in no way grasps the dream, since the soul is everywhere 
that scholarly knowledge is not. 

But how can I attain the knowledge of the heart? You can 
attain this knowledge only by living your life to the full. You 
live your life fully if you also live what you have never yet lived, 
but have lefé for others to live or to think You will say: “But I 
cannot live or think everything that others live or think.” But 
you should say: “The life that I could still live, I should live, and 
the thoughts that I could still think, I should think” Te appears 
as though you want to flee from yourself so as not to have to 
live what remains unlived until now: But you cannot flee from

yourself. It is with you all the time and demands fulfillment 
If you pretend to be blind and dumb to this demand, you feign 
being blind and deaf to yourself. This way you will never reach 
the knowledge of the heart. 

“The knowledge of your heart is how your heart is 

From a cunning heart you will know cunning 

From a good heart you will know goodness. 

So that your understanding becomes perfect, consider that your 
heart is both good and evil, You ask, “What? Should I also live evil?” 

“The spirit of the depths demands: “The life that you could still 
live, you should live. Well-being decides, not your well-being, not 
the well-being of the others, but only well-being.” 

Well-being is between me and others, in society. I, too, lived: 
which I had not done before, and which I could still do. I lived 
into the depths, and the depths began to speak. The depths taught 
me the other truth. Ie thus united sense and nonsense in me. 

Thad to recognize that I am only the expression and symbol of 
the soul. In the sense of the spirit of the depths, [am as T am in

completely subjugated, utterly obedient. The spirit of the depths 
taught me to say: “I am the servant of achild.” Through this dictum

The spirit of this time of course allowed me to believe in my 
reason. He let me see myself in the image of a leader with ripe 
thoughts. But the spirit of the depths teaches me that I am a 
servant, in fact the servant of a child. This dictum was repugnant 
to me and I hated it. But I had to recognize and accept that my 
soul is a child and that my God in my soul is a child” 


If you are boys, your God is a woman, 

Lf you are women, your God is boy.

My God is a child, so wonder not that the spirit of this time in 
me is incensed to mockery and scorn, There will be no one who 
will laugh at me as T laughed at myself 

‘Your God should not be a man of mockery, rather you yourself 
will be the man of mockery. You should mock yourself and rise 
above this, If you have still not learned this from the old holy 
books, then go there, drink the blood and eat the flesh of him who 
‘was mocked and tormented for the sake of our sins, so that you 
totally become his nature, deny his being-apart-from-you; you 
should be he himself, not Christians but Christ, otherwise you 
will be of no use to the coming God. 

Is there any one among you who believes he can be spared the 
‘way? Can he swindle his way past the pain of Christ? I say: “Such 
a one deceives himself to his own detriment. He beds down on 
thorns and fire, No one can be spared the way of Christ, since this 
‘way leads to what is to come. You should all become Christs.° 

You do not overcome the old teaching through doing less, but 
through doing more. Every step closer to my soul excites the scornful 
laughter of my devils, those cowardly ear-whisperers and poison-mixers, 
Iewas easy for them to laugh, since I had to do strange things.

swaying bridges I go. Where are you leading me? Forgive my 
excessive apprchension, brimful of knowledge. My foot hesitates 
to follow you, Into what mist and darkness does your path lead? 
Must I also learn to do without meaning? If this is what you 
demand, then so be it. This hour belongs to you. What is there, 
where there is no meaning? Only nonsense, or madness, it seems 
to me. Is there also a supreme meaning? Is that your meaning, 
my soul? I limp after you on crutches of understanding, I am 
aman and you stride like a God. What torture! I must return 
to myself, to my smallest things. I saw the things of my soul as 
small, pitiably small. You force me to see them as large, to make 
them large, Is that your aim? I follow, but it terrifies me. Hear 
my doubts, otherwise I cannot follow, since your meaning is a 
supreme meaning, and your steps are the steps of a God. 

T understand, I must not chink either; should thought, too, no 
longer be? I should give myself completely into your hands—but 
who are you? I do not trust you. Not once to trust, is that my love 
for you, my joy in you? Do I not trust every valiant man, and not 
you, my soul? Your hand lies heavy on me, but I will, I will. Have 
T not sought to love men and trust them, and should I not do this 
with you? Forget my doubts, I know it is ignoble to doubt you, 
You know how difficult it is for me to set aside the beggar’s pride 
1 take in my own thought. I forgot that you are also one of my 
friends, and have the first right to my trust, Should what I give 
them not belong to you? I recognize my injustice. It seems to me 
that I despised you. My joy at finding you again was not genuine. 
also recognize that the scornful laughter in me was right. 

T must learn to love you." Should I also set aside self-judgment? 
I am afraid. Then the soul spoke to me and said: “This fear 
testifies against me!” It is true, it testifies against you. It kills the 
holy trust between you and me. 

[2] How hard i fate! Ifyou tae a step toward your soul, you wil at frst, 
smiss the meaning. You will believe that you have sunk into meaninglessness, 
{nto eternal disorder. You will be right! Nothing wil deliver you from disorder 
and meaninglessness, since this isthe other half of the world. 

Your God is a child so long as you are not childlike. 1s the child order, 
meaning? Or disorder, caprice? Disorder and meaninglessness are the mother 
of order and meaning. Order and meaning are things that have become and 
are no longer becoming, 

You open the gates ofthe soul to let the dark, fod of chaos flow into your 
order and meaning. If you marry the ordered to the chaos you produce the 
divine chil, the supreme meaning beyond meaning and meaninglessess 

You are afraid to open the door? I too was afraid, since we had forgotten 
that God is terrible. Christ taught: God is love.* But you should know that 
love is also terrible 

1 spoke roa loving soul and as I drew nearer to her, I was overcome by 
horror, and I heaped up a wall of doubs, and did not anticipate that I thus 
‘wanted to protect myself from my fearful soul. 


THE DESERT | 235 


You dread the depths; i should horrify you, since the way of what is to 
come leads through it. You must endure the temptation of fear and doubt, 
and at the same time acknowledge tothe bone that your fee i justified and 
your doubt is reasonable. How otherwise /could it be a true temptation and a 
true overcoming? 

Christ rtaly overcomes the temptation of the devil, but not the temptation 
af God to good and reason.” Christ thus succumbs fo cursing 

‘You sil have to learn this, to succumb to no temptation, but to do every- 
‘hing of your own will then you willbe free and beyond Christianity 

have had to recognize that I must submit 0 what I fears yes, even more, 
that T must even love what horrifes me. We must learn such from that saint 
swho was disgusted bythe plague infections; she drank the pus of plague boils and 
became aware that it smelled like roses. The acts ofthe saint were not in vain.® 

In everything regarding your salvation and the attainment of mercy, you 
are dependent on your soul. Thus no sacrifice can be toogreat for you, If your 
virtues hinder you from salvation, discard them, since they have become evil 
to you. The slave to virtue finds the way as litle as the slave to vices” 

If you believe that you are the master of your soul, then become her ser- 
vant. Ifyou were her servant, make yourself her master, since she need t be 
ruled, These should be your first steps. 


During six further nights, the spirit of the depths was silent in 
me, since I swayed between fear, defiance, and nausea, and was 
wholly the prey of my passion. I could not and did not want to 
listen to the depths. But on the seventh night, the spirit of the 
depths spoke to me: “Look into your depths, pray to your depths, 
waken the dead.”* 

But I stood helpless and did not know what I could do. I 
looked into myself, and the only ching I found within was the 
memory of earlier dreams, all of which I wrote down without 
knowing what good this would do. I wanted to throw everything 
away and feturn to the light of day: But the spirit stopped me and 
forced me back into myself 


The Desert

Sixth night. My soul leads me into the desert, into the desert 
of my own self I did not think that my soul is a desert, a barren, 
hot desert, dusty and without drink. The journey leads through 
hot sand, slowly wading without a visible goal to hope for? How 
cerie is this wasteland. It seems to me that the way leads so far 
away from mankind. I take my way step by step, and do not know 
how long my journey will last.

myself? But I have avoided the place of my soul. I was my thoughts, 
after I was no longer events and other men. But I was not my 
self confronted with my thoughts. I should also rise up above my 
thoughts to my own self, My journey goes there, and that is why it 
leads away from men and events into solitude. Is it solitude, to be 
with oneself? Solitude is true only when the selfs a desert.” Should 
1 also make a garden out of the desert? Should I people a desolate 
land? Should I open the airy magic garden of the wilderness? What 
leads me into the desert, and what am I to do there? Isita deception 
that I can no longer trust my thoughts? Only life is true, and only 
life leads me into the desert, truly not my thinking, that would like to 
return to thoughts, co men and events, since it feels uncanny in the 
desert. My soul, what am I to do here? But my soul spoke to me and 
said, “Wait” I heard the cruel word. Torment belongs to the desert* 

“Through giving my soul all I could give, I came to the place of 
the soul and found that this place was a hot desert, desolate and 
unfruitful, No culture of the mind is enough to make a garden 
out of your soul, I had cultivated my spitie, the spirit of this time 
in me, but not that spirit of the depths that turns to the things 
of the soul, the world of the soul. The soul has its own peculiar 
‘world. Only the self enters in there, or the man who has completely 
become his self, he who is neither in everits, nor in men, nor in 
his thoughts, Through the turning of my desice from things and 
men, I turned my self away from things and men, but that is 
precisely how I became the secure prey of my thoughts, yes, I 
wholly became my thoughts 


[2] [also had to detach myself from my thoughts through turning 
my desire away from them, And at once, I noticed that my self 
became a desert, where only the sun of unquiet desire burned. I 
was overwhelmed by the endless infertility of this desert. Even if 
something could have thrived there, the creative power of desire 
was still absent. Wherever the creative power of desire is, there 
springs the soil’s own seed. But do not forget to wait. Did you not 
sce that when your creative force turned to the world, how the 
dead things moved under it and through it, how they grew and 
prospered, and how your thoughts flowed in rich rivers? If your 
creative force now turns to the place of the soul, you will see how 
your soul becomes green and how its field bears wonderful fruit. 

Nobody can spare themselves the waiting and most will be 
tunable to bear this torment, but will throw themselves with greed 
back at men, things, and thoughts, whose slaves they will become 
from then on. Since then it will have been clearly proved that this 
man is incapable of enduring beyond things, men, and thoughts, 
and they will hence become his master and he will become their 
fool, since he cannot be without them, not until even his soul 
has become a fruitful field. Also he whose soul is a garden, needs 
things, men, and thoughts, but he is their friend and not their 
slave and fool 

Everything to come was already in images: to find their soul, 
the ancients went into the desert.” This is an image. The ancients 
lived their symbols, since the world had not yet become real for 
them, Thus they went into the solitude of the desert to teach 
us that the place of the soul is a lonely desert. There they found 


the abundance of visions, the fruits of the desert, the wondrous 
flowers of the soul. Think diligently about the images that the 
ancients have left behind. They show the way of what is to come. 
Look back at the collapse of empires, of growth and death, of the 
desert and monasteries, they are the images of what is to come. 
Everything has been foretold, But who knows how to interpret it? 

‘When you say that the place of the soul is not, then it is not 
But if you say that it is, then it is. Notice what the ancients said 
in images: the word is a creative act. The ancients said: in the 
beginning was the Word.” Consider this and think upon it. 

The words that oscillate between nonsense and supreme 
meaning are the oldest and truest. 


Experiences in the Desert 
[HT ii@) 2] 


After a hard struggle I have come a piece of the way nearer to 
you. How hard this struggle was! I had fallen into an undergrowth 
of doubt, confusion, and scorn. I recognize that I must be alone 
with my soul. I come with empty hands to you, my soul. What 
do you want to hear? But my soul spoke to me and said, “If you 
come to a friend, do you come to take?" I knew that this should 
not be so, but it seems to me that I am poor and empty, I would 
like to sit down near you and at least feel the breath of your 
animating presence, My way is hot sand. Alll day long, sandy, dusty 
paths, My patience is sometimes weak, and once I despaired of 
myself, as you know. 

My soul answered and said, “You speak to me as if you were a 
child complaining to its mother. am not your mother.” I do not 
want to complain, but let me say to you that mine is a long and 
dusty road. You are to me like a shady tree in the wilderness. I 
would like to enjoy your shade, But my soul answered, “You are 
pleasure-seeking. Where is your patience? Your time has not yet 
run its course. Have you forgotten why you went into the desert?” 

My faith is weak, my face is blind from all that shimmering 
blaze of the desert sun. The heat lies on me like lead. Thirst 
torments me, I dare not think how unendingly long my way is, 
and above all, I see nothing in front of me. But the soul answered, 
“You speak as if you have still learned nothing, Can you not wait? 
Should everything fall into your lap ripe and finished? You are 
full, yes, you teem with intentions and desirousness!—Do you 
still not know that the way to truth stands open only to those 
without intentions?” 

T know that everything you say, Oh my soul, is also my thought. 
But I hardly live according to it. The soul said, “How, tell me, do 
you then believe that your thoughts should help you?” I would 
always like to refer to the fact that | am a human being, just a 
human being who is weak and sometimes does not do his best 
But the soul said, “Is this what you think it means to be human?” 
‘You are hard, my soul, but you are right. How little we still commit 
ourselves to living. We should grow like a tree that likewise 
does not know its law. We tie ourselves up with intentions, 
not mindful of the fact that intention is the limitation, yes, the

‘we presume to want to know in advance, from where the light will 
come to us? 

Let me bring only one complaint before you: I suffer from 
scorn, my own scorn, But my soul said to me, “Do you think 
little of yourself?” I do not believe so. My soul answered, “Then 
listen, do you think little of me? Do you still not know that 
you are not writing a book to feed your vanity, but that you 
are speaking with me? How can you suffer from scorn if you 
address me with those words that I give you? Do you know, 
then, who I am? Have you grasped me, defined me, and made 
me into a dead formula? Have you measured the depths of my 
chasms, and explored all the ways down which I am yet going to 
lead you? Scorn cannot challenge you if you are not vain to the 
marrow of your bones.” Your truth is hard. I want to lay down 
my vanity before you, since it blinds me. See, that is why I also 
believed my hands were empty when I came to you today. I did 
not consider that itis you who fills empty hands if only they want 
to stretch out, yer they do not want to. I did not know that I am 
your vessel, empty without you but brimming over with you. 

[2] This was my twenty-fifth night in the desert. This is how 
long it took my soul to awaken from a shadowy being to her own 
life, until she could approach me as a free-standing being sepa- 
rate from me. And I received hard but salutary words from her. I 
needed that taking in hand, since I could not overcome the scorn 
within me. 

The spirit of this time considers itself extremely clever, like every such 
spirit of the sime, But wisdom is simpleminded, not just simple, Because of 
this, the clever person mocks wisdom, since mockery is his weapon. He uses 
the pointed, poisonous weapon, because he és struck by naive wisdom. If he 
were not struck, he would not need the weapon. Only in the desert do we 
become aware of our terrible simplemindeduess, but we are afraid of admitting 
4t.That is why we are scornfi. But mockery / does not attain simpleminded- 
suss. The mockery flls on the mocker, and in the desert where no one hears 
and answers, he suffocates from his own scorn 

‘The cleverer you are, the more foolish your simplemindedness. The torally 
clever are total fools in their simplemindedness. We cannot save ourselves 
_from the cleverness ofthe sprit ofthis time through increasing our cleverness, 
bus through acepting what our cleverness hates most, namely sinpleminded- 
ness, Yet we also do not want to be artificial fools because we have fallen 
into simplemindedness, rather we willbe clever fol. That leads othe supreme 
‘meaning. Cleverness couples itself with intention. Simplemindedness knows 
so intention, Clevernessconguers the worl, but simplemindedness, the sou 
So take on the vow of poverty of spirit in order to partake ofthe soul”

‘Against this the scorm of my cleverness rose up** Many wil laugh at my 
foolishness. But no one will laugh more chan I laughed at myself. 

So I overcame scorn, But when I had overcome it, I was near to my soul 
and she could speae ro me, and I was soon tose the desert becoming green 


Descent into Hell

[HI iii@)] 
Cap. x 


“In the following night, the air was filled with many voices. 
A loud voice called, “I am falling.” Others cried out confused and 
excited during this: “Where to? What do you want?” Should I 
entrust myself to this confusion? I shuddered. It is a dreadful deep. 
Do you want me to leave myself to chance, to the madness of my 
own darkness? Wither? Wither? You fall, and I want to fall with 
you, whoever you are 

The spirit of the depths opened my eyes and I caught a glimpse 
of the inner things, the world of my soul, the many-formed and 
changing. [Image iii(¥) 1] 


1 see a geay rock face along which I sink into great depths." 
1 stand in black dirt up to my ankles in a dark cave. Shadows 
sweep over me. I am seized by fear, but I know I must go in. 
1 crawl through a narrow crack in the rock and reach an inner 
cave whose bottom is covered with black water. But beyond this I 
catch a glimpse of a luminous red stone which I must reach. I wade 
through the muddy water. The cave is full of the frightful noise 
of shricking voices.” I take the stone, it covers a dark opening in the 
rock. I hold the stone in my hand, peering around inquiringly. I do 
not want to listen to the voices, they keep me away: But I want to 
know, Here something wants to be uttered. I place my ear to the 
opening. I hear the flow of underground waters. I see the bloody 
head of a man on the dark stream. Someone wounded, someone 
slain floats there. I take in this image for a long time, shuddering 
1 see a large black scarab floating past on the dark stream. 

In the deepest reach of the stream shines a red sun, radiating 
through the dark water. There I see—and a terror seizes me—small 
serpents on the dark rock walls, striving toward the depths, 
where the sun shines. A thousand serpents crowd around, veiling 
the sun, Deep night falls. A red stream of blood, thick red blood 
springs up, surging for a long time, then ebbing. I am seized by 
feat. What did I see? [Image iii(v) 2]

Heal the wounds that doubt inflicts on me, my soul, That too 
is to be overcome, so that I can recognize your supreme meaning. 
How far away everything is, and how I have turned back! My 
spirit is a spirie of torment, it tears asunder my contemplation, it 
‘would dismantle everything and rip it apart. [ am still a victim of 
my thinking. When can I order my thinking to be quiet, so that 
my thoughts, those unruly hounds, will crawl to my feet? How 
can I ever hope to hear your voice louder, to see your face clearer, 
when all my thoughts howl? 

Lam stunned, but I want to be stunned, since I have sworn to 
you, my soul, to trust you even if you lead me through madness. 
How shall I ever walk under your sun if I do not drink the bitter 
draught of slumber to the lees? Help me so that I do not choke 
on my own knowledge. The fullness of my knowledge threatens 
to fall in on me. My knowledge has a thousand voices, an army 
roaring like lions; the air trembles when they speak, and I am 
their defenseless sacrifice. Keep it far from me, science that clever 
knower,* that bad prison master who binds the soul and imprisons 
it in a lightless cell. But above all protect me from the serpent of 
judgment, which only appears to be a healing serpent, yet in your 
depths is infernal poison and agonizing death. I want to go down 
cleansed into your depths with white garments and not rush in 
like some thief, seizing whatever I can and fleeing breathlessly 
Let me persist in divine’ astonishment, so that Iam ready to 
behold your wonders, Let me lay my head on a stone before your 
door, so that I am prepared to receive your light. 





[2] When the desert begins to bloom, it brings forth strange 
plants, You will consider yourself mad, and in a certain sense you 
will in fact be mad.* To the extent that the Christianity of this 
time lacks madness, it lacks divine life. Take note of what the 
ancients taught us in images: madness is divine. But because 
the ancients lived this image concretely in events, it became a 
deception for us, since we became masters of the reality of the 
world. Ie is unquestionable: if you enter into the world of the 
soul, you are like a madman, and a doctor would consider you to 
be sick. What I say here can be seen as sickness, but no one can 
see it as sickness more than I do. 


“This is how I overcame madness. If you do not know what divine 
madness is, suspend judgment and wait for the fruits.°° But know 
that there is a divine madness which is nothing other than the 
‘overpowering of the spirit of this time through the spirit of the 
depths. Speak then of sick delusion when the spirit of the depths 
can no longer stay down and forces a man to speak in tongues 
instead of in human speech, and makes him believe that he 
himself is the spirit of the depths. But also speak of sick delusion 
when the spirit of this time does not leave a man and forces him 
to see only the surface, to deny the spirit of the depths and to 
take himself for the spirit of the times. The spirit of this time is 
ungodly, the spirit of the depths is ungodly; balance is godly. 

Because I was caught up in the spirit of this time, precisely 
what happened to me on this night had to happen to me, namely 
that the spirit of the depths erupted with force, and swept away 
the spirit of th 
depths had gained this power, because I had spoken to my soul 
during 25 nights in the desert and I had given her all my love 
and submission, But during the 25 days, I gave all my love and 
submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. 
I went into the desert only at night 

Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever 
does the one and does without the other you may call sick since 
he is out of balance. 

But who can withstand fear when the divine intoxication 
and madness comes to him? Love, soul, and God are beautiful 
and terrible. The ancients brought over some of the beauty of 
God into this world, and this world became so beautiful that it 
appeared to the spirit of the time to be fulfillment, and better 
than the bosom of the Godhead. The frightfulness and cruelty 
of the world lay under wraps and in the depths of our hearts. If 
the spirit of the depths seizes you, you will feel the cruelty and 
exy out in torment. The spirit of the depths is pregnant with ice 
fire, and death. You are right to fear the spirit of the depths, as 
he is full of horror. 

You sce in these days what the spirit of the depths bore. You 
did not believe it, but you would have known it if you had taken

Blood shone at me from the red light of the crystal, and when 
I picked it up to discover its mystery, there lay the horror uncov- 
ered before me: in the depths of what is to come lay murder, 
The blond hero lay slain, The black beetle is the death that is 
necessary for renewal; and so thereafter, a new sun glowed, the 
sun of the depths, full of riddles, a sun of the night. And as the 
rising sun of spring quickens the dead earth, so the sun of the 
depths quickened the dead, and thus began the terrible struggle 
between light and darkness, Out of that burst the powerful and 
ever unvanquished source of blood. This was what was to come, 
which you now experience in your life, and it is even more than 
that. (I had this vision on the night of 12 December 1913,) 

Depths and surface should mix so that new life can develop. 
Yet the new life does not develop outside of us, but within 
us, What happens outside us in these days is the image thar the 
peoples live in events, to bequeath this image immemorially to 
far-off times so that they might learn from it for their own way, just 
as we learned from the images that the ancients had lived before 
us in events. 

Life does not come from events, but from us. Everything that 
happens outside has already been. 

Therefore whoever considers the event from outside always ses only that 
it already was, and that tis abways the same, But whoever looks from inside, 
[knows that everything és new. The events that happen are always the same. 
But the creative depths of man are not always the same, Events signify noth 
ing they signify only in us. We create the meaning of events. The meaning i 
and always was artificial. We make it. 

Because of this we seek in ourselves the meaning of events, so thatthe way 
of /what is 10 come becomes apparent and our life can flow again 

That which you need comes from yourself, namely the meaning of the 
event, The meaning of events is not their particular meaning. This meaning 
exits in learned books. Events have no meaning. 

The meaning of events isthe way of salvation that you create, The meaning 
of events comes from the possibility of life in this world that you create. Tt is 
the mastery ofthis world and the assertion of your soul inthis world. 

This meaning of events is the supreme meaning, that isnot in events, 
and notin the soul, but is the God standing beeween events and the soul, the 
mediator of ie the way, the bridge and the going acrass > 

I would not have been able to see what was to come if I could 
not have seen it in myself, 

Therefore I take part in that murder; the sun of the depths 
also shines in me after the murder has been accomplished; the 
thousand serpents that want to devour the sun are also in me. I 
myself am a murderer and murdered, sacrificer and sacrificed.” 
‘The upwelling blood streams out of me 


DESCENT INTO HELL IN THE FUTURE | 239 


You all have a share in the murder In you the reborn one will 
come to be, and the sun of the depths will rise, and a thousand 
serpents will develop from your dead matter and fall on the sun 
to choke it. Your blood will stream forth. The peoples demonstrate 
this at the present time in unforgettable acts, that will be written 
with blood in unforgettable books for eternal memory 

But I ask you, when do men fall on their brothers with mighty 
weapons and bloody acts? They do such if they do not know that 
their brother is themselves. They themselves are sacrficers, but 
they mutually do the service of sacrifice. They must all sacrifice 
each other, since the time has not yet come when man puts the 
bloody knife into himself, in order to sacrifice the one he kills in 
his brother. But whom do people kill? They kill the noble, the 
brave, the heroes. They take aim at these and do not know that 
with these they mean themselves, They should sacrifice the hero 
in themselves, and because they do not know this, they kill their 
courageous brother. 

The time is still not ripe, But through this blood sacrifice, 
it should ripen. So long as it is possible to murder the brother 
instead of oneself, the time is not ripe. Frightful things must happen 
until men grow ripe. But anything else will not ripen humanity. 
Hence all this that takes place in these days must also be, so that 
the renewal can come. Since the source of blood that follows the 
shrouding of the sun is also the source of the new life” 

As the fate of the peoples is represented to you in events, 
so will it happen in your heart. If the hero in you is slain, then 
the sun of the depths rises in you, glowing from afar, and from 
a dreadful place. But all che same, everything that up till now 
seemed to be dead in you will come to life, and will change into 
poisonous serpents that will cover the sun, and you will fll into 
night and confusion. Your blood also will stream from many 
wounds in this frightful struggle. Your shock and doubs will be 
great, but from such torment the new life will be born. Birth is 
blood and torment. Your darkness, which you did not suspect 
since it was dead, will come to life and you will feel the crush of 
total evil and the conflicts of life that still now lie buried in 
the matter of your body. But the serpents are dreadful evil 
thoughts and feelings 

You thought you knew that abyss? Oh you clever people! 
It is another thing to experience it. Everything will happen to 
you. Think of all the frightful and devilish things that men have 
inflicted on their brothers, That should happen to you in your 
heart. Suffer it yourself through your own hand, and know that it 
is your own heinous and devilish hand that inflicts the suffering 
on you, but not your brother, who wrestles with his own devils”

I would like you to see what the murdered hero means. 
Those nameless men who in our day have murdered a prince 
are blind prophets who demonstrate in events what then is valid 
only for the soul." Through the murder of princes we will learn 
that the prince in us, the hero, is threatened” Whether this 
should be seen as a good or a bad sign need not concern us. What 
is awful today is good in a hundred years, and in two hundred 
years is bad again. But we must recognize what is happening: 
there are nameless ones in you who threaten your prince, the 
hereditary ruler. 

But our ruler is the spirit of this time, which rules and 
leads in us all. It is the general spirit in which we think and act 
today, He is of frightful power, since he has brought immeasur- 
able good to this world and fascinated men with unbelievable 
pleasure. He is bejewelled with the most beautiful heroic virtue, 
and wants to drive men up to the brightest solar heights, in 
everlasting ascent.” 

The hero wants to open up everything he can, Bue the 
nameless spirit of the depths evokes everything that man cannot, 
Incapacity prevents further ascent. Greater height requires greater 
virtue. We do not possess it, We must first create it by learning to 
live with our incapacity. We must give it life. For how else shall it 
develop into ability? 

We cannot slay our incapacity and rise above it. But that 
is precisely what we wanted. Incapacity will overcome us and 
demand its share of life, Our ability will desert us, and we will 
believe, in the sense of the spisit of this time, that it is a loss 
Yer it is no loss but a gain, not for outer trappings, however, but 
for inner capability. 

The one who learns to live with his incapacity has learned a 
‘great deal. This will lead us to the valuation of the smallest things, 
and to wise limitation, which the greater height demands. If all 
heroism is erased, we fall back into the misery of humanity and 
into even worse. Our foundations will be caught up in excitement 
since our highest tension, which concerns what lies outside us, 
will stir chem up. We will fall into the cesspool of our underworld, 
among the rubble of all the centuries in us." 

The heroic in you is the fact that you are ruled by the 
thought that this or that is good, that this or that performance 
is indispensable, this or that cause is objectionable, this or that 
goal must be attained in headlong striving work, this or that 
pleasure should be ruthlessly repressed at all costs. Consequently 
you sin against incapacity. But incapacity exists, No one should 
deny it, find fault with it, or shout it down."

But on the fourth night I cried, “To journey to Hell means to

On this desert path there is not just glowing sand, but also horrible 
tangled invisible beings who live in the desert. I didn’t know this,

attach themselves to me and daimonically change my form. I have 
evidently taken on a completely monstrous form in which I can no 
longer recognize myself. It seems to me that I have become a 
monstrous animal form for which I have exchanged my humanity. 
This way is surrounded by hellish magic, invisible nooses have 
been thrown over me and ensnare me.” 

But the spirit of the depths approached me and said, “Climb 
down into your depths, sink!” 

But I was indignant at him and said, “How can I sink? I am 
tunable to do this myselE” 

Then the spirit spoke words to me that appeared ridiculous, 
and he said, “Sit yourself down, be calm.” 

But I cried out indignantly: “How frightful, it sounds like 
nonsense, do you also demand this of me? You overthrew the mighty 
Gods who mean the most to us. My soul, where are you? Have I 
entrusted myself to a stupid animal, do T stagger like a drunkard 
to the grave, do I stammer stupidities like a lunatic? Is this your 
way, my soul? The blood boils in me and I would strangle you if I 
could seize you. You weave the thickest darknesses and I am like 
amadman caught in your net. But I yearn, teach me.” 

Bur my soul spoke to me saying, “My path is light.” 

Yer I indignantly answered, “Do you call light what we men 
call the worst darkness? Do you call day night?” 

To this my soul spoke a word that roused my anger: “My light 
is not of this world.” 

I cried, “I know of no other world.” 

The soul answered, “Should it not exist because you know 
nothing of it?” I: “But our knowledge? Does our knowledge also 
not hold good for you? What is it going to be, if not knowledge? 
Where is security? Where is solid ground? Where is light? Your 
darkness is not only darker than night, but bottomless as well. If 
it’s not going to be knowledge, then perhaps it will do without 
speech and words too?” 


98 In The Relvions brween the 1 andthe Unconscious (1927), Jung refers to the desteuctive and anarchic aspects that ae constellated in societies being enacted by propherically 


fnclined individuals though spectacular crimes such as repicide (CW 7, §240). 


99 Political assassinations were frequent atthe beginning ofthe ewentieth century. The particular event referred to here isthe assassination of Archduke Frane Ferdinand. 
Marin Gilbert esribs this event, which played ctl olen the evens that edo de outreak ofthe st Word Wa "trang points the history ofthe

continues: “Everything that we have forgotten will be revived, each human and divine passion, the black serpents and the reddish sun of the depths" (p. 64). 


02 On June 9, 1917 there was a discussion on the psychology of the world war in the Assocation for Analytical Psychology following a presentation by Jules Vodo2 on the 
‘Song of Roland. Jang argued chat "Hypothetically the World War can be raised ta the subjective level. In detail, che authoritarian principle (aking action on the basis of 
principles) clashes with the emotional principle. The collective unconscious enters into allegiance with the emotional.” Concerning the hero, he said- "The hero—the 
beloved figure of the people, should fall ll heroes bring themselves down by carrying the heroic attitude beyond a certain limit. and hence lose thie footing” (MAP. 

‘ol. 2, p10). The psychological interpretation of che First World War on the subjective level describes what is developed inthis chapter. The connection beswoen indi- 
Vidual and collective psychology which he articulates here forms one ofthe leitmosfsofhis later work (cf Present aud Future [1957], CW 10) 

10 In Beyond Good and Evi, Niewsche wrote: "Anyone who fights with monsters should take care chat he does notin the process become a monster. And ifyou giz for long. 

Jnto an abys,the abyss gazes back into you’ (tr Marion Faber [Oxford: Oxford University Press]. 1998, 6146, p. 68). 


My souk “No words.” 

I: “Forgive me, perhaps I'm hard of hearing, perhaps I 
misinterpret you, perhaps I ensnare myself in self-deceit and 
monkey business, and I am a rascal grinning at myself in a mirror, a 
fool in my own madhouse. Perhaps you stumble over my folly?” 

My soul: “You delude yourself, you do not deceive me. Your 
words are lies to you, not me.” 

I: “But could I wallow in raging nonsense, and hatch absurdity 
and perverse monotony?” 

My soul: “Who gives you thoughts and words? Do you make 
them? Are you not my serf, a recipient who lies at my door and 
picks up my alms? And you dare think that what you devise and 
speak could be nonsense? Don’t you know yet that it comes from 
me and belongs to me?” 

So I cried full of anges, “But then my indignation must also 
come from you, and in me you are indignant against yoursel” My 
soul then spoke the ambiguous words: “That is civil war.”** 

I was afflicted with pain and rage, and I answered back, 
“How painful, my soul, to hear you use hollow words; I feel sick. 
Comedy and drivel—but I yearn. I can also craw! through mud 
and the most despised banality. I can also eat dust; that is part 
of Hell, I do not yield, 1 am defiant. You can go on devising 
torments, spider-legged monsters, ridiculous, hideous, frightful 
theatrical spectacles. Come close, I am ready. Ready, my soul, you 
who are a devil, to wrestle with you too. You donned the mask of, 
God, and I worshiped you. Now you wear the mask of a devil, a 
frightful one, the mask of the banal, of eternal mediocrity! Only 
one favor! Give me a moment to step back and consider! Is the 
struggle with this mask worthwhile? Was the mask of God worth 
‘worshiping? I cannot do it, the lust for battle burns in my limbs 
No, I cannot leave the battlefield defeated. I want to seize you, crush 
you, monkey, buffoon, Woe if the struggle is unequal, my hands 
grab at air. But your blows are also air, and I perceive trickery.”

MURDER OF THE HERO | 241 


1 felt myself transformed into a rapacious beast. My heart 
glowered in rage against the high and beloved, against my prince 
and hero, just as the nameless one of the people, driven by greed 
for murder, lunged at his dear prince. Because I carried the 
murder in me, I foresaw it"* 

Because I carried the war in me, I foresaw it.I felt betrayed and 
lied to by my king, Why did I feel this way? He was not as I had 
‘wished him to be. He was other than I expected. He should be the 
king in my sense, not in his sense. He should be what I called ideal. 
My soul appeared to me hollow, tasteless and meaningless. But in 
reality what I thought of her was valid for my ideal 

It-was a / vision of the desert, I struggled with mirror images 
of myself, It was civil war in me, I myself was the murderer and 
the murdered. The deadly arrow was stuck in my heart, and I did 
not know what it meant. My thoughts were murder and the fear 
of death, which spread like poison everywhere in my body. 

‘And thus was the fate of the people: The murder of one was 
the poisonous arrow that flew into the hearts of men, and 
kindled the fiercest war. This murder is the indignation of 
incapacity against will, a Judas betrayal that one would like 
someone else to have committed." We are still seeking the goat 
that should bear our sin."* 

Everything that becomes too old becomes evil, the same is srue of your 
highest. Learn from the suffering ofthe crucified God that one can also betray 
and crucify a God, namely the God ofthe old year. Ifa God ceases being the 
way of lif, he must fll secretly” 

“The God becomes sick if he ovesteps the height of the zenith. That is why the 
spirit ofthe depts took me when the spirit ofthis time had ed met the sum."

the turn ahead of us, we fired at the same time and he fell slain. 
‘Thereupon I turned to flee, and a terrible rain swept down. 
But after this" I went through a torment unto death and I felt 
certain that I must kill myself, if I could not solve the riddle of 
the murder of the hero."* 

“Then the spirit of the depths came to me and spoke these words 

“The highest truth is one and the-same with the absurd.” This 
statement saved me, and like rain after a long hot spell, it swept 
away everything in me which was too highly tensed. 

Then I had a second vision:" I saw a merry garden, in which 
forms walked clad in white silk, all covered in colored light, some 
reddish, the others blueish and greenish.” [Image iv(v)] 


T know, I have stridden across the depths, Through guilt I have 
become a newborn." 


[2] We also live in our dreams, we do not live only by day: 
Sometimes we accomplish our greatest deeds in dreams.” 

In that night my life was threatened since I had to kill my lord 
and God, not in single combat, since who among mortals could 
kill a God in a duel? You can reach your God only as an assassin,” 
if you want to overcome him. 

Bue this is the bitterest for mortal men: our Gods want to be 
overcome, since they require renewal. If men kill their princes, 
they do so because they cannot kill their Gods, and because they 
do not know that they should kill their Gods in themselves 

If the God grows old he becomes shadow, nonsense, and he goes down. The 
_greatet truth becomes the greatest lie, the brightest day becomes darkest night. 

‘As day requires night and night requires day, 50 meaning requires absurdity 
and absurdity requires meaning. 

Day does not exist through itself, night doesnot exist through itself 

The realty that exists through itself is day and night. 

othe relity is meaning and absurdity. 

Noon is « moment, midnight is a moment, morning comes from nigh, 
evening urns into night, bu evening comes from the day and morning turns 
into day. 

So meaning is a moment and a transition from absurdity to 
absurdity, and absurdity only a moment and a transition from 
meaning to meaning.” 


14 The Draft continues: After chs dream vision” (p. 73) 


Oh that Siegfried, blond and blue-eyed, the German hero, 
had to fall by my hand, the most loyal and courageous! He had 
everything in himself that I treasured as the greater and more 
beautiful; he was my power, my boldness, my pride. I would have 
gone under in the same battle, and so only assassination was 
left to me. If I wanted to go on living, it could only be through 
trickery and cunning, 

Judge not! Think of the blond savage of the German forests, 
‘who had to betray the hammer-brandishing thunder to the pale 
Near-Eastern God who was nailed to the wood like a chicken 
marten, The courageous were overcome by a certain contempt 
for themselves. But their life force bade them to go on living, 
and they betrayed their beautiful wild Gods, their holy trees 
and their awe of the German forests. 

‘What does Siegfried mean for the Germans! What does it 
tell us that the Germans suffer Siegfried’s death! That is why 
I almost preferred to kill myself in order to spare him. But 
wanted to go on living with a new God.” 

‘After death on the cross Christ went into the underworld 
and became Hell. So he took on the form of the Antichrist, the 
dragon. The image of the Antichrist, which has come down to 
us from the ancients, announces the new God, whose coming 
the ancients had foreseen. 

Gods are unavoidable. The more you flee from the God, the 
more surely you fall into his hand. 

The rain is the great stream of tears that will come over the 
peoples, the tearful flood of released tension after the constriction 
of death had encumbered the peoples with horrific force. It 
is the mourning of the dead in me, which precedes burial and 
rebirth, The cain is the fructifying of the earth, it begets the 
new wheat, the young, germinating God.

that was conceived in the womb of a virgin, became a God to

As I spoke thus, the spirit of the depths suddenly erupted. 
He filled me with intoxication and mist and spoke these words 
with a powerful voice: [OB iv (v)] “Ihave received your sprout, you who

I covered it in shabby patchwork and bedded down on poor words

THE CONCEPTION OF THE GOD | 243 


[2] When my prince had fallen, the spirit of the depths opened 
my vision and let me become aware of the birth of the new God. 

The divine child approached me out of the terrible ambiguity, 
the hateful-beautiful, the evil-good, the laughable-serious, the 
sick-healthy, the inhuman-human and the ungodly-godly.”* 

T understood that the God” whom we seek in the absolute 
wwas not to be found in absolute beauty, goodness, seriousness, 
elevation, humanity or even in godliness, Once the God was there. 

I understood that the new God would be in the relative 
If the God is absolute beauty and goodness, how should he 
encompass the fullness of life, which is beautiful and hateful, 
good and evil, laughable and serious, human and inhuman? 
How can man live in the womb of the God if the Godhead 
himself attends only to one-half of him?" 

If we have risen near the heights of good and evil, then our 
badness and hatefulness lie in the most extreme torment. Man’s 
torment is so great and the air of the heights so weak that he can 
hardly live anymore. The good and the beautiful freeze to the 
ice of the absolute idea,” and the bad and hateful become mud 
puddles full of crazy life. 

Therefore after his death Christ had to journey to Hell, 
otherwise the ascent to Heaven would have become impos- 
sible for him. Christ first had to become his Antichrist, his 
underworldly brother. 

No one knows what happened during the three days Christ 
‘was in Hell. I have experienced it® The men of yore said that he 
had preached there to the deceased" What they say is true, but 
do you know how this happened? 

It was folly and monkey business, an atrocious Hells 
masquerade of the holiest mysteries. How else could Christ have 
saved his Antichrist? Read the unknown books of the ancients, 
and you will learn much from them. Notice that Christ did not 
remain in Hell, but rose to the heights in the beyond.”* 

Our conviction of the value of the good and beautiful has 
become strong and unshakable, that is why life can extend 
beyond this and still fulfil everything that lay bound and yearning 
But the bound and yearning is also the hateful and bad. Are you 
again indignant about the hateful and the bad? 

‘Through this you can recognize how great are their force 
and value for life. Do you think that it is dead in you? But 
this dead can also change into serpents. These serpents will 
extinguish the prince of your days. 





1a5 A reference to Christ's parable of the mustard seed. Matthew 1331-32: “The kingdom of heaven i like to grain of mustard seed, which 2 man took, and sowed in his 
field: Which indeed isthe least of ll seeds: but when iis grown, i isthe greatest among hetbs, and becometh a tece” (CE Luke 1318-20, Mark 430-32). 
126 In Mark 16:17, Christ stated that those who belive shall speak with new tongues, The issue of speaking in tongues i discussed in 1 Corinthians 14 2nd is centel in the 


Pentecostal movement 


1a7 The theme of self-overcoming isan important one in the work of Nietzsche. In Tha Spoke Zarathustra, Nietasche writes: “I teach you the Superman. Man is something 
that should be overcome, What have you done to overcome him? All exeacures hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and do you want to be the ebb 


of thi 2 tothe animal 


han overcome man? ("Zarathusta’s prologue 3,” p. 41; underlined asin Jung's copy) For Jung’s discussion ofthis 


theme in Nietzsche, see Nietasche's Zarathustra: Notes ofthe Seminar Gite 1994-3, vol. 2, ed. James Jaret: (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988, pp. 502-08). 


18 Judas betrayed Christ for thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26-14-16) 
19 See note 58, p.234. 


130-This conception ofthe encompassing nature ofthe new God is fully developed further ahead in Scrtinies (Sermon 2, p. 349). 

151 The theme of the integration of evil nto the Godhead played an important role in Jung’s works ee Aion (1951, CW 9,2, ch. §), and Answer t Jab (1952, CW 1). 

152 The conception of the absolute ides was developed by Hegel. He understood it asthe culmination and the self differentiating unity ofthe dialectical sequence that 
gives rise «0 the cosmos. Cf. Hegels Lage (t: W. Wallace [London: Thames and Hudsoa, 1973). Jung refers to this in 1921 in Psychological Types (CW 6, $735)

194 1 Peter 46 states: "For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that chey might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according t0 


God in the spirit” 


135 The theme of Christ's descent into Hell features in several apocryphal gospels. Inthe “Apostles Creed," it is stated that “He descended into Hell. The tied day He 
arose again from the dead " Jung commented on the appearance ofthis mocif in medieval alchemy (Psyholgy ond Alchemy, 1944, CW 12, §61n, 440, 451; Myteium 
‘Contunctons, 1955/56, CW 14,478). One ofthe sources which Jung referred to (CW 12, $61) was Albreche Dieterich’ Nel: Betrage sur Erdlrang der netnadecten 
Petrsapohalpse, which commented on an apocalyptic fragment from the Gospel of St. Petes, in which Christ gives a detailed description of Hell. Jung's copy ofthis 
‘work has numerous matkings in the margins, and in the ear ae two additional pieces of paper with alist of page references and remarks. In 1951 he gave the following, 
psychological interpretation of the motif of Christ's descent into Hell: "The scape ofthe integration is suggested by the ‘descensus ad infernos’ the descent of Christ's 
Sol t0 Hell, whose work of redemption also encompasses the dead. The psychological equivalent ofthis forms the integration of the collective unconscious which 





Fepresents an essentil part ofthe indi 


luation process" (Aion, CW 9, 2, $72). In 1938 he noted: "The three days descen¢ into Hell during death describes the sinking 


‘of the vanished value into the unconscious, where, by conquering the power of darkness, it establishes 2 new order, and then rises up to heaven again, that is, attains 
supteme clarity of consciousness” (‘Psychology and religion,” CW 11, $149). The “unknown books of the ancients” refer to the apoctyphal gospe!s. 

136 The Draft continues: “Buc the serpent is also lif. In the image furnished by the ancients, the serpent pur an end to the childlike magnificence of paradise; they even 
sid that Christ himself had been a sexpent”(p. 83). Jung commented on this motif in 1950 in Aton, CW 9, 2, $291

afraid of them, It is good, though, that you fear yourselves; say 
i out loud that you are afraid of yourselves. Ie is wisdom to fear 
oneself. Only the heroes say that they are fearless, But you know 
what happens to the hero. 

‘With fear and trembling, looking around yourselves with 
mistrust, go thus into the depths, but do not do this alone; two 
oor more is greater secutity since the depths are full of murder. Also 
secure yourselves the way of retreat. Go cautiously as if you were 
cowards, so that you pre-empt the soul murderers." The depths 
would like to devour you whole and choke you in mud. 

He who journeys to Hell also becomes Hell; therefore do not 
forget from whence you come. The depths are stronger than us 
so do not be heroes, be clever and drop the heroics, since nothing is 
more dangerous than to play the hero. The depths want to keep 
you: they have not returned very many up to now, and therefore 
men fled from the depths and attacked them. 

What if the depths, due to the assault, now change themselves 
into death? But the depths indeed have changed themselves 
into death; therefore when they awoke they inflicted a thousand- 
fold death. We cannot slay death, as we have already taken all 
life from it. If we still want to overcome death, then we must 
enliven it 

Therefore on your journey be sure to take golden cups full of the 
sweet drink of life, red wine, and give itto dead matter, so that it can 
win life back. The dead matter will change into black serpents. 
Do not be frightened, the serpents will immediately put out the 
sun of your days, and a night with wonderful will-o’-the-wisps 
will come over you." 

“Take pains to waken the dead. Dig deep mines and throw in 
sacrificial gifts, so that they reach the dead. Reflect in good heart 
upon evil, this is the way to the ascent. But before the ascent, 
everything is night and Hell. 

‘What do you think of the essence of Hell? Hell is when the 
depths come to you with all that you no longer are or are not yet 
capable of, Hell is when you can no longer attain what you could 
attain, Hell is when you must think and feel and do everything 
that you know you do not want. Hell is when you know that your 
having to is also awanting to, and that you yourself are responsible 
for it. Hell is when you know that everything serious that you 
have planned with yourself is also laughable, that everything fine 


is also brutal, that everything good is also bad, that everything 
high is also low, and that everything pleasant is also shameful 

But the deepest Hell is when you realize that Hell is also no 
Hell, but a cheerful Heaven, not a Heaven in itself, but in this 
respect a Heaven, and in that respect a Hell. 

That is the ambiguity of the God: he is born from a dark 
ambiguity and rises to a bright ambiguity. Unequivocalness is 
simplicity and leads to death." But ambiguity is the way of life’ 
If the left foot does not move, then the right one does, and you 
move. The God wills this.* 

You say: the Christian God is unequivocal, he is love."* But 
what is more ambiguous than love? Love is the way of life, but 
yout love is only on the way of life if you have a left and a right. 

Nothing is easier than to play at ambiguity and nothing is 
more difficult than living ambiguity. He who plays is a child; his 
God is old and dies. He who lives is awakened; his God is young 
and goes on. He who plays hides from the inner death. He who 
lives feels the going onward and immortality. So leave the play 
to the players, Let fall what wants to fall; if you stop it, it will 
sweep you away. There is a true love that does not concern itself 
with neighbors.** 

When the hero was slain and the meaning recognized in 
the absurdity, when all tension came rushing down from gravid 
clouds, when everything had become cowardly and looked to its 
own rescue, I became aware of the birth of the God.“ Opposing 
me, the God sank into my heart when I was confused by mockery 
and worship, by grief and laughter, by yes and no. 

The one arose from the melting together of the two. He was 
born as a child from my own human soul, which had conceived him 
with resistance like a viegin. Thus it corresponds to the image that 
the ancients have given to us” But when the mother, my soul, was 
pregnant with the God, I did not know it, It even seemed to me as 
if my soul herself was the God, although he lived only in her body:* 

And thus the image of the ancients is fulfilled: I pursued my 
soul to kill the child in it, For I am also the worst enemy of my 
God.” But I also recognized that my enmity is decided upon in 
the God. He is mockery and hate and anger, since this is also a 
way of life. 

I must say that the God could not come into being before the 
hero had been slain. The hero as we understand him has become an. 
enemy of the God, since the hero is perfection. The Gods envy the 
perfection of man, because perfection has no need of the Gods, But 
since no one is perfect, we need the Gods. The Gods love perfection 
because it is the toral way of life. But the Gods are not with him

who wishes to be perfect, because he is an imitation of perfection” 

Imitation was a way of life when men still needed the heroic 
prototype." The monkey’s manner is a way of life for monkeys, 
and for man as long as he is like a monkey. Human apishness has 
lasted a terribly long time, but the time will come when a piece of 
that apishness will fall away from men. 

That will be a time of salvation and the dove, and the eternal 
fire, and redemption will descend, 

Then there will no longer be a hero, and no one who can 
imitate him. Because from that time henceforth all imitation 
is cursed. The new God laughs at imitation and discipleship. He 
needs no imitators and no pupils. He forces men through himself. 
The God is his own follower in man. He imitates himself 

We think that there is singleness within us, and communality 
outside us, Outside of us is the communal in relation to the 
external, while singleness refers to us. We are single if we are in 
ourselves, but communal in relation to what is outside us, Bue 
if we are outside of ourselves, then we are single and selfish in the 
communal. Our self suffers privation if we are outside ourselves, 
and thus it satisfies its needs with communality. Consequently, 
communality is distorted into singleness. If we are in ourselves, we 
fulfil the need of the self, we prosper, and through this we become 
aware of the needs of the communal and can fulfil them.” 

If we set a God outside of ourselves, he tears us loose from the 
self, since the God is more powerful than we are. Our self falls 
into privation. But if the God moves into the self, he snatches us 
from what is outside us." We arrive at singleness in ourselves, So 
the God becomes communal in reference to what is outside us, 
but single in relation to us, No one has my God, but my God has 
everyone, including myself. The Gods ofall individual men always 
have all other men, including myself. So ie is always only the one 
God despite his multiplicity: You arrive at him in yourself and only 
through your self seizing you. It seizes you in the advancement 
of your life 

“The hero must fall for the sake of our redemption, since he is 
the model and demands imitation, Bur the measure of imitation 
is fulfilled We should become reconciled to solitude in ourselves 
and to the God outside of us. If we enter into this solitude then 
the life of the God begins. If we are in ourselves, then the space 
around us is free, but filled by the God. 

Our relations to men go through this empty space and also 
through the God. But earlier it went through selfishness since we 
‘were outside ourselves, Therefore the spirit foretold to me that the 
cold of outer space will spread across the earth.” With this he 
showed me in an image that the God will step between men and 
dive every individual with the whip of icy cold to the warmth of his 
own monastic hearth. Because people were beside themselves, 
going into raptures like madmen. 


MYSTERIUM, ENCOUNTER | 245 


Selfish desire ultimately desires itself. You find yourself in your 
desire, so do not say that desire is vain. If you desire yourself, you 
produce the divine son in your embrace with yourself. Your desire 
is the father of the God, your self is the mother of the God, but 
the son is the new God, your master. 

If you embrace your self, then it will appear to you as if the 
‘world has become cold and empty. The coming God moves into 
this emptiness, 

If you are in your solitude, and all the space around you has 
become cold and unending, then you have moved far from men, 
and at the same time you have come near to them as never before. 
Selfish desire only apparently led you to men, but in reality it led 
you away from them and in the end to yourself, which to you and 
to others was the most remote. But now, if you are in solitude, 
your God leads you to the God of others, and through that to the 
true neighbor, to the neighbor of the self in others. 

If you are in yourself, you become aware of your incapacity. 
You will see how little capable you are of imitating the heroes and 
of being a hero yourself. So you will also no longer force others to 
become heroes. Like you, they suffer from incapacity, Incapacity, 
100, wants to live, but it will overthrow your Gods. [BP v ()]/

Cap. ix 


On the night when I considered the essence of the God, I 
became aware of an image: I lay in a dark depth. An old man 
stood before me, He looked like one of the old prophets." A 
black serpent lay at his feet. Some distance away I saw a house 
with columns, A beautiful maiden steps out of the door. She 
walks uncertainly and I see that she is blind, The old man waves 
to me and I follow him to the house at the foot of the sheer wall 
of rock. The serpent creeps behind us. Darkness reigns inside 
the house. We are in a high hall with glittering walls, A bright 
stone the color of water lies in the background. As I look into its 
reflection, the images of Eve, the tree, and the serpent appear to 
me. After this I catch sight of Odysseus and his journey on the 
high seas. Suddenly a door opens on the right, onto a garden full 
of bright sunshine. We step outside and the old man says to me, 
“Do you know where you are?” 

I: “I am a stranger here and everything seems strange to me, 
anxious as in a dream. Who are you?” 

E: “Lam Elijah’ and this is my daughter Salome." 

I: “The daughter of Herod, the bloodthirsty woman?”

S: "You will love me.” 

I:"I? Love you? Who gives you the right to such thoughts?” 

S: "I love you.” 

I: "Leave me be, I dread you, you beast.” 

S:"You do me wrong. Elijah is my father, and he knows the 
deepest mysteries. The walls of his house are made of precious 
stones, His wells hold healing water and his eyes see the things of 
the future. And what wouldn’t you give for a single look into the 
infinite unfolding of what is to come? Are these not worth a sin 
for you?” 

I:*Your temptation is devilish, I long to be back in the upper 
world. Ie is dreadful here, How oppressive and heavy is the air!” 

E: "What do you want? The choice is yours.” 

I: “But I do nor belong to the dead. I live in the light of day. 
‘Why should I torment myself here with Salome? Do T not have 
enough of my own life to deal with?” 

E: “You heard what Salome said.” 

I: “I cannot believe that you, the prophet, can recognize her 
asa daughter and a companion. Is she not engendered from hei- 
nous seed? Was she not vain greed and criminal lust?” 

E: “But she loved a holy man.” 

I: “And shamefully shed his precious blood.” 

E; “She loved the prophet who announced the new God 
to the world, She loved him, do you understand that? For she is 
my daughter.” 

I: “Do you think that because she is your daughters, she loved 
the prophet in John, the father?” 

E: "By her love shall you know her.” 


I: “But how did she love him? Do you call that love?” 

E: “What else was it?” 

I: “I am horrified. Who wouldn't be horrified if Salome 
loved him?” 

E: “Are you cowardly? Consider this, I and my daughter have 
been one since eternity” 

I: “You pose dreadful riddles. How could it be that this unholy 
‘woman and you, the prophet of your God, could be one?” 

E: “Why are you amazed? But you see it, we are together.” 

I:"What my eyes see is exactly what I cannot grasp. You, Elijah, 
‘who are a prophet, the mouth of God, and she, a bloodthirsty horror. 
‘You are the symbol of the most extreme contradiction.” 

E:“We are real and not symbols.” 

1 see how the black serpent writhes up the tree, and hides in 
the branches. Everything becomes gloomy and doubtful. Elijah 
rises, I follow and we go silently back through the hall.” Doubt 
tears me apart. It is all so unreal and yet a part of my longing 
remains behind. Will I come again? Salome loves me, do I love 
her? I hear wild music, a tambourine, a sultry moonlit night, the 
bloody-staring head of the holy one'*—fear seizes me, I rush out, 
I am surrounded by the dark night. It is pitch black all around 
me. Who murdered the hero? Is this why Salome loves me? Do I 
love her, and did I therefore murder the hero? She is one with the 
prophet, one with John, but also one with me? Woe, was she the 
hhand of the God? I do not love her, I fear her. Then the spirit of the 
depths spoke to me and said: “Therein you acknowledge her divine 
power.” Must I love Salome?"

and serve you asa guide in the world of darkness, since iti of ike substance 
with the forms ofthat world: [Image v (v)]!* 

The scene of the mystery play is a deep place like the crater of 
avoleano, My deep interior is a volcano, that pushes out the fiery- 
molten mass of the unformed and the undifferentiated. Thus my 
interior gives birth to the children of chaos, of the primordial 
mother. He who enters the crater also becomes chaotic matter, 
he melts. The formed in him dissolves and binds itself anew with 
the children of chaos, the powers of darkness, the ruling and the 
seducing, the compelling and the alluring, the divine and the 
devilish. These powers stretch beyond my certainties and limits 
on all sides, and connect me with all forms and with all distant 
beings and things, through which inner tidings of their being and 
their character develop in me, 

Because I have fallen into the source of chaos, into the primordial 
beginning, I myself become smelted anew in the connection with 
the primordial beginning, which at the same time is what has 
been and what is becoming. At first I come to the primordial 
beginning in myself, But because I am a part of the matter and 
formation of the world, I also come into the primordial beginning 
of the world in the first place. I have certainly participated in life 
as someone formed and determined, but only through my formed 
and determined consciousness and through this in a formed and 
determined piece of the whole world, but not in the unformed 
and undetermined aspects of the world that likewise are given to 
ime, Yet itis given only to my depths, not to my surface, which is a 
formed and determined consciousness 

The powers of my depths are predetermination and pleasure." 
redetermination or forethinking™ is Prometheus,** who, without 
determined thoughts, brings the chaotic to form'® and definition, 
who digs the channels and holds the object before pleasure. 
Forethinking also comes before thought. But pleasure is the force 
that desires and destroys forms without form and definition. It 
loves the form in itself that it takes hold of, and destroys the forms 
that it does not take. The forethinker is a seer, but pleasure is blind. 
Ie-does not foresee, but desires what it touches. Forethinking is not 
powerful in itself and therefore does not move. But pleasure is 
power, and therefore it moves. Forethinking needs pleasure to 
be able to come to form, Pleasure needs forethinking to come 
to form, which it requires.” If pleasure lacked forming, pleasure 
would dissolve in manifoldness and become splintered and 
powerless through unending division, lost to the unending, If 
a form does not contain and compress pleasure within itself, 
it cannot reach the higher, since it always flows like water from 
above to below. All pleasure, when left alone, flows into the deep 
sea and ends in the deathly stillness of dispersal into unending

space. Pleasure is not older than forethinking, and forethinking 
is not older than pleasure. Both are equally old and in nature 
intimately one, Only in man does the separate existence of both 
principles become apparent. 

Apart from Elijah and Salome I found the serpent as a third 
principle.” It is a stranger to both principles although it is 
associated with both. The serpent taught me the unconditional 
difference in essence between the two principles in me. If look 
across from forethinking to pleasure, I first see the deterrent 
poisonous serpent. If I feel from pleasure across to forethinking, 
likewise I feel first the cold cruel serpent." The serpent is the 
earthly essence of man of which he is not conscious. Its character 
changes according to peoples and lands, since it is the mystery 
that flows to him from the nourishing earth-mother"” 

“The earthly (numen loci) separates forethinking and pleasure 
in man, but not in itself. The serpent has the weight of the earth 
in itself, but also its changeability and germination from which 
everything that becomes emerges, Itis always the serpent that causes 
‘man to become enslaved now to one, now to the other principle, 
so that it becomes error. One cannot live with forethinking alone 
or with pleasure alone. You need both. But you cannot be 
in forethinking and in pleasure at the same time, you must take 
turns being in forethinking and pleasure, obeying the prevailing 
law, unfaithful to the other so to speak. But men prefer one or the 
other. Some love thinking and establish the art of life on it. They 
practice their thinking and their circumspection, so they lose their 
pleasure. Therefore they are old and have a sharp face. The others 
love pleasure, they practice their feeling and living, Thus they forget 
thinking. Therefore they are young and blind. Those who think 
base the world on thought, those who feel, on feeling. You find 
truth and error in both 

“The way of life writhes like the serpent from sight to left and 
from left to right, from thinking to pleasure and from pleasure 
to thinking, Thus the serpent is an adversary and a symbol of 
enmity, but also a wise bridge that connects right and left through, 
longing, much needed by our life.”* 

The place where Elijah and Salome live together is a dark 
space and a bright one, The dark space is the space of fore- 
thinking. It is dark, so he who lives there requires vision.”* 
This space is limited, so forethinking does not lead into the 
extended distance, but into the depth of the past and the 
facure. The crystal is the formed thought that reflects what is 
to come in what has gone before. 

Eve / and the serpent show me that my next step leads to 
pleasure and from there again on lengthy wanderings like

bright garden is the space of pleasure, He who lives there needs 
no vision; he feels the unending” A thinker who descends into 
his forethinking finds his next step leading into the garden of 
Salome, Therefore the thinker fears his forethought, although 
he lives on the foundation of forethinking. The visible surface 
is safer than the underground. Thinking protects against the 
way of error, and therefore it leads to petrification. 

‘A thinker should fear Salome, since she wants his head, 
especially ifhe is a holy man, A thinker cannot be a holy person, 
otherwise he loses his head. It does not help to hide oneself in 
thought. There the solidification overtakes you. You must turn 
back to motherly forethought to obtain renewal. But forethought 
leads to Salome. 

Because I was a thinker and caught sight of the hostile 
principle of pleasure from forethinking, it appeared to me as 
Salome. If I had been oné who felt, and had groped my way 
toward forethinking, then it would have appeared to me as a 
serpent-encoiled daimon, if I had actually seen it. But I would 
have been blind. Therefore I would have felt only slippery, dead, 
dangerous, allegedly overcome, insipid, and mawkish things, 
and I would have pulled back with the same shudder I felt in 
turning from Salome. 

The thinker’s passions are bad, therefore he has no pleasure 
The thoughts of one who feels" are bad, therefore he has no 
thoughts, He who prefers to think than to feel," leaves his 
feeling” to rot in darkness. Ie does not grow ripe, but in moldi- 
ness produces sick tendrils that do not reach the light. He who 
prefers to feel than to think leaves his thinking in darkness, 
where it spins its nets in gloomy places, desolate webs in which 
mosquitos and gnats become enmeshed. The thinker feels the 
disgust of feeling, since the feeling in him is mainly disgusting, 
The one who feels thinks the disgust of thinking, since the 
thinking in him is mainly disgusting, So the serpent lies between 
the thinker and the one who feels. They are each other’s poison 
and healing 

In the garden it had to become apparent to me that I loved 
Salome. This recognition struck me, since I had not thought it. 
What a thinker does not think he believes does not exist, and 
what one who feels does not feel he believes does not exist. You 
begin to have a presentiment of the whole when you embrace 
‘your opposite principle, since the whole belongs to both principles, 
which grow from one root 

Elijah said: “You should recognize her through her love!” Not 
only do you venerate the object, but the object also sanctifies 
you. Salome loved the prophet, and this sanctified her. The 
prophet loved God, and this sanctified him. But Salome did not 
love God, and this profaned her. But the prophet did not love 
Salome, and this profaned him. And thus they were each other’s

Cap. x, 

On the following night, I was led to a second image: I am 
standing in the rocky depth that seems to me like a crater: Before 
me I see the house with columns, I see Salome walking along the 
length of the wall toward the left, touching the wall like a blind 
person. The serpent follows her. The old man stands at the door 
and waves to me. Hesitantly I draw closer. He calls Salome back. 
She is like someone suffering. I cannot detect any sacrilege in her 
nature, Her hands are white and her face has a gentle expression. 
The serpent lies before them. I stand before them clumsily like a 
stupid boy, overwhelmed by uncertainty and ambiguity. The old 
man eyes me searchingly and says: “What do you want here?” 

1: “Forgive me, it is not obtrusiveness or arrogance that leads 
me here, I am here perchance, not knowing what I want. A longing 
that stayed behind in your house yesterday has brought me here. 
You see, prophet, I am tired, my head is as heavy as lead. I am 
lose in my ignorance. I have toyed with myself enough. I played 
hypocritical games with myself and they all would have disgusted 
me, were it not clever to perform what others expect from us in 
the world of men, It seems to me as if I were more real here. And 
yet I do not like being here.” 

Wordlessly Elijah and Salome step inside the house. I follow 
them reluctantly. A feeling of guilt torments me, Isitbad conscience? 
1 would like to turn back, but I cannot. I stand before the play 
of fire in the shining crystal. I see in splendor the mother of God 
with the child, Peter stands in front of her in admiration—then 
Peter alone with the key—the Pope with a triple crown—a 
Buddha sitting rigidly in a circle of fire—a many-armed bloody 
Goddess"*—it is Salome desperately wringing her hands”—it 
takes hold of me, she is my own soul, and now I see Elijah in the 
image of the stone. 

Elijah and Salome stand smiling before me 

1; "These visions ace full of torment, and the meaning of these 
images is dark to me, Elijah; please shed some light.” 

Elijah turns away silently, and leads the way toward the left 
Salome enters a colonnade to the right. Elijah leads me into an 
even darker room, A burning red lamp hangs from the ceiling. I 
sit down exhausted. Elijah stands before me leaning on a marble 
lion in the middle of the room.

directed toward the objec (extraversion) of toward the subject (introversion): CW 6. Commencing in the summer of 1915 he had extensive correspondence with 
“Hans Schmid on this question, in which he now characterized the introverts 3: being dominated bythe function of thinking. and the extrverts sx being dominated by 
the function of feeling. He also characterized che exteaverts as being dominated by the pleasure-pein mechanism, seking out the love ofthe abject. and unconsciously

subject in 1917 in The Psychology of the Unconscious Process. In Psyelaepcl Types (1921), this model had expanded ro encompass two main attitude types of introverts 
and extraverts further subdivided by the predominance of one ofthe four psychological functione of thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition.

urge toward forbidden knowledge that causes your feeling of 
guilt. Why do you think you are here?” 

I: “T don’t know. I sank into this place when unknowingly 
I tried resisting the not-known, So here I am, astonished and 
confused, an ignorant fool. I experience strange things in your 
house, things that frighten me and whose meaning is dark to me.” 

E; “Ifit were not your law to be here, how would you be here?” 

I: “I'm afilicted by fatal weakness, my father.” 

E: "You are evasive. You cannot extricate yourself from your law 

I; “How can I extricate myself from what is unknown to me, 
which I cannot reach with either feeling or presentiment?” 

E: “You are lying. Do you not know that you yourself 
recognized what it means if Salome loves you?” 

I: “You are right. A doubeful and uncertain thought arose in 
me. But I have forgotten it again.” 

E: “You have not forgotten it. It burned deep inside you. Are 
you cowardly? Or can you not differentiate this thought from your 
own self, enough so that you wished to claim it for yourself?” 

I: “The thought went too far for me, and I shun far-fetched 
ideas. They are dangerous, since I am a man, and you know how 
much men are accustomed to seeing thoughts as their very own, 
so that they eventually confuse them with themselves.” 

E:“Will you therefore confuse yourself with a tree or animal, 
because you look at them and because you exist with them in one 
and the same world? Must you be your thoughts, because you are 
in the world of your thoughts? But your thoughts are just as much 
outside your self as trees and animals are outside your body”"* 

I: “L understand. My thought world was for me more word 
than world, I thought of my thought world: it is ” 

E: “Do you say to your human world and every being outside 
of you: you are 12" 

I: “I stepped into your house, my father, with the fear of a 
schoolboy. But you taught me salutary wisdom": I can also 
consider my thoughts as being outside my self. That helps me 
to return to that terrible conclusion that my tongue is reluctant 
to express. I thought that Salome loves me because I resemble 
John or you. This thought seemed unbelievable to me. That’s why 
I rejected it and thought that she loves me because I am really 
quite opposite to you, that she loves her badness in my badness 
This thought was devastating.” 

Elijah is silent, Heaviness lies on me. Then Salome steps in, comes 
over to me and lays her arm around my shoulder. She takes me for 
her father in whose chair I sat. I dare neither move nor speak. 

S: “I know that you are not my father. You are his son, and I 
am your sister,” 

I: “You, Salome, my sister? Was this the terrible attraction that 
emanated from you, that unnamable horror of you, of your touch? 
Who was our mother?”

‘When I crossed your threshold today, I foresaw calamity. Alas! Tt 
hhas come. Are you out of your senses, Salome? Elijah, protector 
of the divine law, speak: is this a devilish spell cast by the rejected? 
How can she say such a thing? Or are both of you out of your 
senses? You are symbols and Mary is a symbol. I am simply t00 
confused to see through you now.” 

E: “You may call us symbols for the same reason that you can 
also call your fellow men symbols, if you wish to. But we are just as 
real as your fellow men. You invalidate nothing and solve noth- 
ing by calling us symbols.” 

T: “You plunge me into a terrible confusion. Do you wish to 
be real?”

have to accept us. The choice is yours.”

Behind me a high golden red flame burns on a round altar. The

[2] "Ie is no small matter to acknowledge one’s yearning. 
For this many need to make a particular effort at honesty. All 
too many do not want to know where their yearning is, because 
it would seem to them impossible or too distressing, And yet 
yearning is the way of life, If you do not acknowledge your 
yearning, then you do not follow yourself, but go on foreign ways 
that others have indicated to you. So you do not live your life but 
an alien one. But who should live your life if you do not live it? Te 
is not only stupid to exchange your own life for an alien one, but 
also a hypocritical game, because you can never really live the life 
of others, you can only pretend to do it, deceiving the other and 
yourself, since you can only live your own life 

If you give up your self, you live it in others; thereby you 
become selfish to others, and thus you deceive others. Everyone 
thus believes that such a life is possible. Its, however, only apish 
imitation. Through giving in to your apish appetite, you infect 
others, because the ape stimulates the apish, So you turn your- 
self and others into apes. Through reciprocal imitation you live 
according to the average expectation. The image of the hero was 
set up for all in every age through the appetite for imitation. 
Therefore the hero was murdered, since we have all been aping 
him, Do you know why you cannot abandon apishness? For fear 
of loneliness and defeat. 

Ta live oneself means: to be one’s own task. Never say that it 
is a pleasure to live oneself. Ie will be no joy but a long suffering, 
since you must become your own creator. If you want to create

yourself, then you do not begin with the best and the highest, 
bur with the worst and the deepest. Therefore say that you are 
reluctant to live yourself: The flowing together of the stream of 
life is not joy but pain, since it is power against power, guilt, and 
shatters the sanctified, 

‘The image of the mother of God with the child that I foresee, 
indicates to me the mystery of the transformation.” If forethink- 
ing and pleasure unite in me, a third arises from them, the divine 
son, who is the supreme meaning, the symbol, the passing over into 
a new creation. I do not myself become the supreme meaning’ 
of the symbol, but the symbol becomes in me such that it has its 
substance, and I mine. Thus I stand like Peter in worship before 
the miracle of the transformation and the becoming real of the 
God in me. 

Although I am not the son of the God myself, I represent him 
nevertheless as one who was a mother to the God, and one there- 
fore to whom in the name of the God the freedom of the binding 
and loosing has been given, The binding and loosing take place 
in me. But insofar as it takes place in me, and I am a part of the 
world, it also takes place through me in the world, and no one cant 
hinder it. It doesn’t take place according to the way of my will but 
in the way of unavoidable effect, I am not master over you, but 
the being of the God in me. I lock the past with one key, with the 
other I open the future. This takes place through my transforma- 
tion. The miracle of transformation commands. I am its servant, 
just as the Pope is. 

You see how incredible it was to believe such of oneself™ It 
applies not to me, butto the symbol. The symbol becomes my lord 
and unfailing commander, Ie will fortify its reign and change itself 
into a starry and riddling image, whose meaning turns completely 
inward, and whose pleasure radiates outward like blazing fire,”* 
a Buddha in the flames. Because I sink into my symbol to such 
an extent, the symbol changes me from my one into my other, and 
that cruel Goddess of my interior, my womanly pleasure, my own 
other, the tormented tormentor, that which is to be tormented. I 
have interpreted these images, as best I can, with poor words 


“In the moment of your bewilderment, follow your forethink- 
ing and not your blind desire, since forethinking leads you to the 
difficulties that should always come first. They come nevertheless.

If you look for a light, you fall first into an even deeper darkness. 
In this darkness you find a light with a weak reddish flame that 
gives only a low brightness, but it is enough for you to see your 
neighbor. It is exhausting to reach this goal that seems to be no 
goal. And so it is good: I am paralyzed and therefore ready to 
accept. My forethinking rests on the lion, my power:"* 

T held to the sanctified form, and didn’t want to allow the 
chaos to break through its dams. I believed in the order of 
the world and hated everything disorganized and unformed. 
Therefore above all I had to realize that my own law had 
brought me to this place. As the God developed in me, I 
thought he was a part of my self. I thought that my “I” included 
hhim and therefore I took him for my thought. But I also considered 
that my thoughts were parts of my “I.” Thus I entered into my 
thoughts, and into the thinking about the God, in that I took 
him / for a part of my self 

On account of my thoughts, I had left myself; therefore my 
self became hungry and made God into a selfish thought. If I 
leave myself, my hunger will drive me to find my self in my object, 
that is, in my thought. Therefore you love reasonable and orderly 
thoughts, since you could not endure it if your self was in disordered, 
that is, unsuitable thoughts, Through your selfish wish, you pushed 
out of your thoughts everything that you do not consider ordered, 
that i, unfitting. You create order according to what you know, 
you do not know the thoughts of chaos, and yet they exist. My 
thoughts are not my self, and my I does not embrace the thought 
Your thought has this meaning and that, not just one, but many 
meanings, No one knows how many. 

My thoughts are not my self, but exactly like the things of 
the world, alive and dead." Just as I am not damaged through 
living in a partly chaotic world, so too I am not damaged if I 
live in my partly chaotic thought world. Thoughts are natural 
events that you do not possess, and whose meaning you only 
imperfectly recognize" Thoughts grow in me like a forest, 
populated by many different animals. But man is domineering 
in his thinking, and therefore he kills the pleasure of the forest 
and that of the wild animals. Man is violent in his desire, and 


he himself becomes a forest and a forest animal. Just as I have” 


freedom in the world, I also have freedom in my thoughts 
Freedom is conditional,

To certain things of the world I must say: you should not be 
thus, but you should be different. Yet frst I look carefully at their 
nature, otherwise I cannot change it. I proceed in the same way 
with certain thoughts. You change those things of the world that, 
not being useful in themselves, endanger your welfare. Proceed 
likewise with your thoughts. Nothing is complete, and much is in 
dispute. The way of life is transformation, not exclusion, Well-being 
is a better judge than the law. 

But as I became aware of the freedom in my thought world, 
Salome embraced me and I thus became a prophet, since I had 
found pleasure in the primordial beginning, in the forest, and in 
the wild animals, It stands too close to reason for me to set myself 
on a par with my visions, and for me to take pleasure in seeing. I 
am in danger of believing that I myself am significant since I see 
the significant. This will always drive us crazy, and we transform 
the vision into foolishness and monkey business, since we cannot 
desist from imitation 

Just as my thinking is the son of forethinking, so is my 
pleasure the daughter of love, of the innocent and conceiving 
mother of God. Aside from Christ Mary gave birth to Salome. 
Therefore Christ in the gospel of the Egyptians says to Salome: 
“Eat every herb, but do not eat the bitter.” And when Salome 
wanted to know, Christ spoke to her: “Ifyou crush the covering 
of shame, and when the two become one, and the male with 
the female, neither male nor female.”** 

Forethinking is the procreative, love is the receptive.” Both 
are beyond this world, Here are understanding and pleasure, 
wwe only suspect the other. It would be madness to claim that 
they are in this world. So much that is riddling and cunning 
coils around this light. I won the power back again from the 
depths, and it went before me like a lion. 


Resolution 


[HI iQ 
Cap. xi 


On the third night, deep longing to continue experiencing 
the mysteries seized me. The struggle between doubt and desire 
‘was great in me, But suddenly I saw that I stood before a steep 
ridge in a wasteland. It is a dazzling bright day. I catch sight of the

prophet high above me, His hand makes an averting movement, 
and I abandon my decision to climb up. I wait below, gazing 
upward, I look: to the right it is dark night; to the left it is bright 
day. The rock separates day and night. On the dark side lies a big 
black serpent, on the bright side a white serpent. They thrust 
their heads toward each other, eager for battle. Elijah stands on 
the heights above them. The serpents pounce on one another and 
a terrible wrestling ensues, The black serpent seems to be stronger, 
the white serpent draws back. Great billows of dust rise from the 
place of struggle, But then I see: the black serpent pulls itself back 
again. The front part of its body has become white. Both serpents 
curl about themselves, one in light, the other in darkness.” 

Elijah: “What did you see?" 

1:"T saw the fight of two formidable serpents. It seemed to me 
as if the black would overcome the white serpent; but behold, the 
black one withdrew and its head and the top part of its body had 
turned white” 

E:"Do you understand that?” 

1: “I have thought it over, but I cannot understand it. Should 
it mean that the power of the good light will become so great that 
even the darkness that resists it will be illumined by it?” 

Elijah climbs before me into the heights, toa very high summit, 
1 follow. On the peak we come to some masonry made of huge 
blocks. It is a round embankment on the summit™ Inside lies a 
Jasge courtyard, and there is a mighty boulder in the middle, like an 
altar. The prophet stands on this stone and says: “This is the temple 
of the sun, This place is a vessel, that collects the light of the sun.” 

Elijah climbs down from the stone, his form becomes smaller 
in descending, and finally becomes dwarflike, unlike himself 

Task: “Who are you?” 

“Lam Mime” and I will show you the wellsprings. The collected 
light becomes water and flows in many springs from the summit 
into the valleys of the earth.” He then dives down into a crevice. I 
follow him down into a dark cave. I hear the rippling of a spring, 
T heat the voice of the dwarf from below: “Here are my wells, 
whoever drinks from them becomes wise.” 

But I cannot reach down. I lose courage. I leave the cave 
and, doubting, pace back and forth in the square of the yard 
Everything appears to me strange and incomprehensible. It is 
solitary and deathly silent here. The air is clear and cool as on the 
remotest heights, a wonderful flood of sunlight all around, the

‘great wall surrounds me. A serpent crawls over the stone. It is the 
serpent of the prophet. How did it come out of the underworld 
into the world above? I follow it and see how it crawls into the 
wall, I feel weird all over: a little house stands there with a 
portico, minuscule, snuggling against the rock. The serpents 
become infinitely small. I feel as if I too am shrinking. The walls 
enlarge into a huge mountain and I see that I am below on the 
foundation of the crater in the underworld, and I stand before the 
house of the prophet."* He steps out of the door of his house. 

I: “I notice, Elijah, that you have shown me and let me 
experience all sorts of strange things and allowed me to come 
before you today. But I confess that it is all dark to me. Your 
world appears to me today in a new light, Just now it was as if 
I were separated by a starry distance from your place, which I 
still wanted to reach today. But behold: it seems to be one and 
the same place.” 

E: "You wanted to come here far too much. I did not deceive 
you, you deceived yourself. He sees badly who wants to see; you 
hhave overreached yourself” 

I: “Ie is true, I eagerly longed to reach you, to hear more, 
Salome startled me and led me into bewilderment. I felt dizzy, 
because what she said seemed to me to be monstrous and like 
madness. Where is Salome?” 

E: "How impetuous you are! What is up with you? Step over to 
the crystal and prepare yourself in its light.” 


A wreath of fire shines around the stone, I am seized with 
fear at what I see: The coarse peasant’s boot? The foot of a 
giant that crushes an entire city? I see the cross, the removal 
of the cross, the mourning. How agonizing this sight is! No 
longer do I yearn—I see the divine child, with the white serpent 
in his right hand, and the black serpent in his left hand. I see 
the green mountain, the cross of Christ on it, and a stream of 
blood flowing from the summit of the mountain—I can look no 
longer, itis unbearable—I see the cross and Christ on it in his last 
hour and torment—at the foot of the cross the black serpent 
coils itself—it has wound itself around my feet—I am held 


fast and I spread my arms wide, Salome draws near. The serpent 
has wound itself around my whole body, and my countenance 
is that of a lion, 

Salome says, “Mary was the mother of Christ, do you understand? 

I:"T see that a terrible and incomprehensible power forces me 
to imitate the Lord in his final torment. But how can I presume 
to call Mary my mother?” 

‘S: “You are Christ.” 

I stand with outstretched arms like someone crucified, my 
body taut and horribly entwined by the serpent: “You, Salome, say 
that I am Christ?" 

It is as if T stood alone on a high mountain with stiff 
outstretched arms. The serpent squeezes my body in its terrible 
coils and the blood streams from my body, spilling down the 
mountainside. Salome bends down to my feet and wraps her 
black hair round them. She lies thus for a long time. Then she 
cries, “I see light!” Truly, she sees, her eyes are open. The serpent 
falls from my body and lies languidly on the ground, I stride 
over it and kneel at the feet of the prophet, whose form shines 
like a flame. 

E: “Your work is fulfilled here, Other things will come. Seek 
untiringly, and above all write exactly what you see.” 

Salome looks in rapture at the light that streams from the 
prophet. Elijah transforms into a huge flame of white light. The 
serpent wraps itself around her foot, as if paralyzed. Salome 
kneels before the light in wonderstruck devotion. Tears fall from 
my eyes, and I hurry out into the night, like one who has no part 
in the glory of the mystery. My feet do not touch the ground of 
this earth, and it is as if | were melting into air."* 

[2] °My longing led me up to the overbright day, whose light 
is the opposite to the dark space of forethinking* The opposite 
principle is, as I think I understand it, heavenly love, the mother. 
The darkness that surrounds forethinking” appears to be due to 
the fact that it is invisible in the interior and takes place in the 
depths.” But the brightness of love seems to come from the fact, 
that love is visible life and action. My pleasure was with fore- 
thinking and had its merry garden there, surrounded by darkness 


s4o In the 1935 seminar, Jung interpceted this episode as follows: “the fight ofthe ewo snakes: the white means a movement into the day the black into the kingdom of 
dlrknes, with moral aspects to. There was afeal conflict in me, a esitance to going down. My stronger tendency was to go up Becase I had been so impressed

crater are simile. There was nothing of concious structae in these fasis, they wee just event that happened. So 1 assume that Dante got his deat from the same 
archerypes" (Anh Paco, pp. 96-97). McGuire suggests chat Jungs refering to Dante's conception ofthe conic form ofthe cavity of Fel, with circles 
‘microing in reverse the form of Heaven, with its spheres (Ibid) In Ado, ung also noted tat serpents were a typi pai of opposites, and that the conlict between 
Serpents was a motif found in medieval alchemy (951, CW 9,2, $18). 

211 In the 1935 seminar, Jang recounted that after Salome’s declaration tht he was Christ:“In spite of my objections she maintained ths. said tis is madness’ and 
became filled with skepaal cesitance" (Aula Pcl, p. 96). He interpreted this even a fllows"Salome's approach and her worshiping of me is obvowly that

and night. I climbed down to my pleasure, but ascended to my 
love. I see Elijah high above me: this indicates that forethinking 
stands nearer to love than I, a man, do. Before I ascend to love, 
a condition must be fulfilled, which represents itself as the fight 
between two serpents, Left is day, right is night. The realm of love 
is light, the realm of forethinking is dark. Both principles have 
separated themselves strictly, and are even hostile to one another 
and have taken on the form of serpents. This form indicates the 
daimonic nature of both principles. I recognize in this struggle a 
repetition of that vision where I saw the struggle between the sun 
and the black serpent."* 

‘Acthat time, the loving light was annihilated, and blood began, 
to pour out, This was the great war. But the spirit of the depths” 
wants this struggle to be understood as a conflict in every man’s 
own nature Since after the death of the hero our urge to live 
could no longer imitate anything, ittherefore went into the depths 
of every man and excited the terrible conflict between the powers 
of the depths" Forethinking is singleness, love is togetherness. 
Both need one another, and yet they kill one another. Since men 
do not know that the conflict occurs inside themselves, they go 
mad, / and one lays the blame on the other. Ifone-half of mankind 
is at fault, then every man is half at fault, But he does not see the 
conflict in his own soul, which is however the source of the outer 
disaster, Ifyou are aggravated against your brother, think that you 
are aggravated against the brother in you, that is, against what in 
you is similar to your brother. 

‘As a man you are part of mankind, and therefore you have 
a share in the whole of mankind, as if you were the whole of 
mankind. If you overpower and kill your fellow man who is 
contrary to you, then you also kill that person in yourself and 
have murdered a part of your life. The spirit of this dead man 
follows you and does not let your life become joyful. You need 
your wholeness to live onward. 

If I myself endorse the pure principle, I step to one side and 
become onesided. Therefore my forethinking in the principle™ 
of the heavenly mother becomes an ugly dwarf who lives in a 
dark cave like an unborn in the womb. You do not follow him, 
even if he says to you that you could drink wisdom from his 
source, But forethinking™ appears to you there as dwarfish 
cleverness, false and of the night, just as the heavenly mother 
appears to me down there as Salome. That which is lacking in the 
pure principle appears as the serpent. The hero strives after the 
utmost in the pure principle, and therefore he finally falls for the

serpent, If you go to thinking. take your heart with you. If you 
{0 to love, take your head with you. Love is empty without thinking, 
thinking hollow without love. The serpent lurks behind the pure 
principle. Therefore I lost courage, until I found the serpent that 
at once led me across to the other principle, In climbing down 1 
become smaller: 

Great is he who is in love, since love is the present act of the 
‘great creator, the present moment of the becoming and lapsing of 
the world. Mighty is he who loves. But whoever distances himself 
from love, feels himself powerful 

In your forethinking you recognize the nullity of your current 
being as a smallest point between the infinity of what has passed 
and of what is to come. The thinker is small, he feels great if he 
distances himself from thinking Buc if we speak about appear- 
ances, itis the other way around, To whoever is in love, form is a 
trifling, But his field of vision ends with the form given to him. 
‘To whoever is in thinking, form is unsurpassable and the height 
of Heaven. But at night he sees the diversity of the innumer- 
able worlds and their never-ending cycles. Whoever is in love is 
a fall and overflowing vessel, and awaits the giving. Whoever is 
in forethinking is deep and hollow and awaits fulfillment 

Love and forethinking are in one and the same place. Love 
cannot be without forethinking, and forethinking cannot be 
without love, Man is always too much in one or the other, This 
comes with human nature, Animals and plants seem to have 
enough in every way, only man staggers between too much and 
too little, He wavers, he is uncertain how much he must give 
here and how much there, His knowledge and ability is 
insufficient, and yet he must still do it himself Man doesn’t only 
grow from within himself, for he is also creative” from within 
himself, The God becomes revealed in him.™* Human nature is 
little skilled in divinity, and therefore man fluctuates between 
too much and too little” 

“The spirit of this time has condemned us to haste. You have 
no more futurity and no more past if you serve the spirit of this 
time. We need the life of eternity. We bear the future and the past 
in the depths. The future is old and the past is young. You serve 
the spirit of this time, and believe that you are able to escape the 
spirit of the depths, But the depths do not hesitate any longer 
and will force you into the mysteries of Christ.™* It belongs to 
this mystery that man is not redeemed through the hero, but 
becomes a Christ himself. The antecedent example of the saints 
symbolically teaches us this.

Whoever wants to see will see badly. Te was my will that 
deceived me. It was my will that provoked the huge uproar among, 
the daimons. Should I therefore not want anything? I have, and I 
hhave fulfilled my will as well as I could, and thus I fed everything 
in me that strived. In the end I found that I wanted myself in 
everything, but without looking for myself. Therefore I no longer 
wanted 10 seek myself outside of myself, but within, Then I 
‘wanted to grasp myself, and then I wanted to go on again, without 
knowing what I wanted, and thus | fell into the mystery. 

Should I therefore not want anything anymore? You wanted 
this war. That is good. If you had not, then the evil of this war 
would be small But with your wanting you make the evil great 
If you do not succeed in producing the greatest evil out of this 
war, you will never learn the violent deed and learn to overcome 
fighting what lies outside you.” Therefore it is good if you want 
this greatest evil with your whole heart.” You are Christians and 
run after heroes, and wait for redeemers who should take the 
agony on themselves for you, and totally spare you Golgotha 
With that you pile up a mountain of Calvary over all Europe. 
Ifyou succeed in making a terrible evil out of this war and throw 
innumerable victims into this abyss, this is good, since it makes 
each of you ready to sacrifice himself. For as I, you draw close to 
the accomplishment of Christ's mystery. 

‘You already feel the fist of the iron one on your back. This is 
the beginning of the way: If blood, fire, and the cry of distress 
fill this world, chen you will recognize yourself in your acts 
Drink your fill of the bloody atrocities of the war, feast upon the 
killing and destruction, then your eyes will open, you will see 
that you yourselves are the bearers of such fruit” You are on the 
‘way if you will all this. Willing creates blindness, and blindness 
leads to the way: Should we will error? You should not, but you 
do will that error which you take for the best truth, as men have 
always done. 

The symbol of the crystal signifies the unalterable law of 
events that comes of itself. In this seed you grasp what is to 
come. I saw something terrible and incomprehensible. (Ie was 
on the night of Christmas day of the year 1913.) I saw the 
peasant’s boot, the sign of the horrors of the peasant war,” of 
murdering incendiaries and of bloody cruelty. I knew to interpret 
this sign for myself as nothing but the fact that something 
bloody and dreadful lay before us. I saw the foot of a giant that 
crushed a whole city. How could I interpret this sign otherwise? 
I saw that the way to self-sacrifice began here. They will ll become 
terribly enraptured by these tremendous experiences, and in their

redemption,” p. 161) 


blindness will want to understand them as outer events. It is an 
inner happening: that is the way to the perfection of the mystery 
of Christ so that the peoples learn self-sacrifice 

May the frightfulness become so great that it can turn men’s 
eyes inward, so that their will no longer seeks the self in others 
bbur in themselves.» I saw it, I know that this is the way. I saw 
the death of Christ and I saw his lament; I felt the agony of his 
dying, of the great dying, I saw a new God, a child, who subdued 
daimons in his hand.*” The God holds the separate principles in 
his power, he unites them. The God develops through the union 
of the principles in me, He is their union, 

If you will one of these principles, so you are in one, but far 
from your being other. If you will both principles, one and the 
other, then you excite the conflict between the principles, since 
you cannot want both at the same time, From this arises the 
need, the God appears in it, he takes your conflicting will in his 
hand, in the hand of a child whose will is simple and beyond 
conflict, You cannot learn this, it can only develop in you. You 
cannot will this it takes the will from your hand and wills itself 
Will yourself, that leads to the way."* 

But fundamentally you are terrified of yourself, and therefore 
you prefer to run to all others rather than to yourself. I saw 
the mountain of the sacrifice, and the blood poured in streams 
from its sides. When I saw how pride and power satisfied men, 
how beauty beamed from the eyes of women when the great war 
broke out, I knew that mankind was on the way to self-sacrifice. 

The spirit of the depths has seized mankind and forces 
self-sacrifice upon it, Do not seck the guilt here or there. The 
spirit of the depths clutched the fate of man unto itself, as it 
clutched mine. He leads mankind through the river of blood 
to the mystery. In the mystery man himself becomes the two 
principles, the lion and the serpent. 

Because I also want my being other, I must become a Christ. I 
am made into Christ, I must suffer it. Thus the redeeming blood 
flows. Through the self-sacrifice my pleasure is changed and goes 
above into its higher principle. Love is sighted, but pleasure is 
blind. Both principles are one in the symbol of the flame. The 
principles strip themselves of human form.” 


The mystery showed me in images what I should afterward 


live. I did not possess any of those boons that the mystery showed 
me, for I still had to earn all of them."

The Red One’ 


Cap. 


[HI 2} The door of the Mysterium has closed behind me. I 
feel that my will is paralyzed and that the spirit of the depths 
possesses me. I know nothing about a way. I can therefore neither 
want this nor that, since nothing indicates to me whether I 
wane this or that. I wait, without knowing what I'm waiting for 
But already in the following night I felt that I had reached a 
solid point 

"Lind that I am standing on the highest tower of a castle. The 
air tells me so: I am far back in time. My gaze wanders widely 
over solitary countryside, a combination of fields and forests. I 
am wearing a green garment. A horn hangs from my shoulder. I 
am the tower guard, I look out into the distance. I see a red point 
out there, It comes nearer on a winding road, disappearing for a 
while in forests and reappearing again: itis a horseman in a red 
coat, the red horseman. He is coming to my castle: he is already 
riding through the gate. I hear steps on the stairway, the steps 
creak, he knocks: a strange fear comes over me: there stands the 
Red One, his long shape wholly shrouded in red, even his hair is 
red. I think: in the end he will turn out to be the devil 


The Red One: “I greet you, man on the high tower, I saw you 
from afar, looking and waiting. Your waiting has called me.”

Tam. What sort of a superstitious fellow are you, thai 
you think of the devil?” 

1: “If you have no supernatural ability, how could you feel that 
I stood waiting on my tower, looking out for the unknown and 
the new? My life in the castle is poor, since I always sit here and 
no one climbs up to me.” 

T. R: “So what are you waiting for?” 

1:*I await ll kinds of things, and especially I’m waiting for some 
of the world’s wealth, which we don't see here, to come to me.” 

T. R: "So, I have come to absolutely the right place. I have 
wandered a long time through the world, secking those like you 
who sit upon a high tower on the lookout for things unseen.” 

1: “You make me curious. You seem to be a rare breed. Your 
appearance is not ordinary, and then too—forgive me—it seems 
to me that you bring with you a strange air, something worldly, 
something impudent, or exuberant, or—in fact—something pagan.” 

T.R: “You don’t offend me, on the contrary, you hit your nail 
on the head. But I’m no old pagan as you seem to think.” 

I:"I don’t want to insist on that. You are also not pompous and 
Latin enough. You have nothing classical about you. You seem to 
be a son of our time, but as I must remark, a rather unusual one 
You're no real pagan, but the kind of pagan who runs alongside 
our Christian religion.” 

T. R: “You're truly a good diviner of riddles. You're doing 
better than many others who have totally mistaken me.” 

I: “You sound cool and sneering, Have you never broken your 
heart over the holiest mysteries of our Christian religion?” 

T. R: “You're an unbelievably ponderous and serious person 
‘Are you always so urgent?” 

I: “I would before God always like to be as serious and true to 
myself as I try to be. However, that certainly becomes difficult in 
your presence, You bring a certain gallows air with you, and you're 
bound to be from the black school of Salerno; where pernicious 
arts are taught by pagans and the descendants of pagans.” 

T. R: “You're superstitious and too German. You take literally 
‘what the scriptures say, otherwise you could not judge me so hard.” 

/1:*A haed judgment is the last thing I would want. Bue my 
nose does not play tricks on me. You're evasive, and don’t want to 
reveal yourself, What are you hiding?”

to this place. A spell has banished me to this place and time for 
years. I am really not what you see before you.” 

T. R: “You say astounding things. Who are you then?” 

1:"Thatis irrelevant. I stand before you as that which I presently 
am, Why am I here and like this, I do not know: But I do know 
that I must be here to justify myself according to my best knowledge. 
T know just as little who you are, as you know who Tam.” 

T. R: “That sounds very strange. Are you something of a saint? 
Hardly a philosopher, since you have no aptitude for scholarly 
language. But a saint? Surely that. Your solemnity smells of 
fanaticism. You have an ethical air and a simplicity that smacks 
of stale bread and water.” 

I: “I can say neither yes nor no: you speak as one trapped in 
the spitit of this time. It seems to me that you lack the terms 
of comparison.” 

T. R: “Perhaps you attended the school of the pagans? You 
answer like a sophist? How can you then measure me with the 
yardstick of the Christian religion, if you are no saint?” 

I: “Tt seems to me, though, that one can apply this yardstick 
even if one is no saint. I believe I have learned that no one is allowed 
to avoid the mysteries of the Christian religion unpunished. I 
repeat: he whose heart has not been broken over the Lord Jesus 
Christ drags a pagan around in himself, who holds him back from 
the best.” 

‘T. R: “Again this old tune? What for, if you are not a Christian 
saint? Are you not a damned sophist after all?” 

I: “You are ensnared in your own world, But you certainly 
seem to think that one can assess the worth of Christianity 
correctly without being a downright saint.” 

T. Rs “Are you a doctor of theology, who examines Christianity 
from the outside and appreciates it historically, and therefore a 
sophist after all?” 

1:"You're stubborn, What I mean is that its hardly a coincidence 
that the whole world has become Christian. I also believe that it 
was the task of Western man to carry Christ in his heart and to 
grow with his suffering, death, and resurrection.” 

T. R: “Well, there are also Jews who are good people and yet 
had no need for your solemn gospels.” 

1: "You are, it seems to me, no good reader of people: have 
you never noticed that the Jew himself lacks something—one 
in his head, another in his heart, and he himself feels that he 
lacks something?” 

T.R: "Indeed I'm no Jew, but I must come to the Jews defense 
you seem to be a Jew hater” 

I: “Well, now you speak like all those Jews who accuse anyone 
of Jew hating who does not have a completely favorable judgment, 
while they themselves make the bloodiest jokes about their own 
kkind, Since the Jews only too clearly feel that particular lack and yet 
do not want to admit it, they are extremely sensitive to criticism. 
Do you believe that Christianity left no mark on the souls of men? 
‘And do you believe that one who has not experienced this most 
intimately can still partake of its fruit?" 


T. R: “You argue your case well. But your solemnity?! You 
could make matters much easier for yourself. If you're no saint, 
I really don't see why you have to be so solemn, You wholly 
spoil the fun, What the devil is troubling you? Only Christianity 
with its mournful escape from the world can make people / so 
ponderous and sullen.” 

1: "I think there are still other things that bespeak seriousness” 

T.R: Oh, know, you mean life, I know this phrase. I too live 
and don't let my hair turn white over it. Life doesn't require any 
seriousness, On the contrary, it’s better to dance through life.”" 

I: "know how to dance, Yes, would we could do it by dancing! 
Dancing goes with the mating season. I know that there are those 
who are always in heat, and those who also want to dance for their 
Gods, Some are ridiculous and others enact Antiquity, instead of 
honestly admitting their utter incapacity for such expression.” 

T. R: “Here, my dear fellow, I doff my mask. Now T grow 
somewhat more serious, since this concerns my own province. 
Ie’s conceivable that there is some third thing for which dancing 
‘would be the symbol.” 


The red of the rider transforms itself into a tender reddish 
fiesh color, And behold—Oh miracle—my green garments 
everywhere burst into leaf 


I: "Perhaps too there is a joy before God that one can call 
dancing. But I haven’t yet found this joy. I look out for things that 
are yet to come, Things came, but joy was not among them.” 

T.R: “Don't you recognize me, brother, I am joy!” 

I: “Could you be joy? T see you as through a cloud. Your image 
fades. Let me take your hand, beloved, who are you, who are you?” 

Joy? Was he joy? 


[2] Surely this red one was the devil, but my devil. That is, he 
‘was my joy, the joy of the serious person, who keeps watch alone 
on the high tower—his red-colored, red-scented, warm bright 
red joy: Not the secret joy in his thoughts and in his looking, but 
that strange joy of the world that comes unsuspected like a warm 
southerly wind with swelling fragrant blossoms and the ease of 
living, You know it from your poets, this seriousness, when they 
expectantly look toward what happens in the depths, sought out 
first ofall by the devil because of their springlike joy.” Ie picks up 
men like a wave and drives them forth. Whoever tastes this joy 
forgets himself And there is nothing sweeter than forgetting 
oneself. And not a few have forgotten what they are. But even 
‘more have taken root so firmly that not even the rosy wave is able 
to uproot them. They are petrified and too heavy, while the others 
are too light 

I earnestly confronted my devil and behaved with him as with 
a real person. This I learned in the Mysterium: to take seriously 
every unknown wanderer who personally inhabits the inner world, 
since they are real because they are effectual” It does not help that 
wwe say in the spirit of this time: there is no devil. There was one

with me. This took place in me. I did with him what I could. I 
could speak with him. A religious conversation is inevitable with 
the devil, since he demands it, if one does not want to surrender 
to him unconditionally. Because religion is precisely what the 
devil and I cannot agree about. I must have it out with him, as 
T cannot expect that he as an independent personality would 
accept my standpoint without further ado. 

I would be fleeing if I did not try to come to an understanding 
with him. Fever you have the rare opportunity to speak with the 
devil, then do not forget to confront him in all seriousness. He is 
your devil after all. The devil as the adversary is your own other 
standpoint; he tempts you and sets a stone in your path where you 
least want it 

Taking the devil seriously does not mean going over to his 
side, or else one becomes the devil. Rather it means coming to an 
understanding. Thereby you accept your other standpoint. With 
that the devil fundamentally loses ground, and so do you. And 
that may be well and good, 

‘Although the devil very much abhors religion for its particular 
solemnity and candor, it has become apparent, however, that it 
is precisely through religion that the devil can be brought to an 
understanding. What I said about dancing struck him because I 
spoke about something that belonged in his own domain. He fails 
to take seriously only what concerns others because that is the 
peculiarity of all devils. In such a manner, I arrive at his seriousness, 
and with this we reach common / ground where understanding is 
possible. The devil is convinced that dancing is neither lust nor 
madness, but an expression of joy, which is something proper to 
neither one nor the other. In this I agree with the devil. Therefore 
he humanizes himself before my eyes. But I turn green like a 
tee in spring. 

Yer that joy is the devil, or that the devil is joy, has got to 
worry you. I pondered this for over a week, and I fear that it has 
not been enough. You dispute the fact that your joy is your devil 
But it seems as if there is always something devilish about joy: If 
your joy is no devil for you, then possibly itis for your neighbors, 
since joy is the most supreme flowering and greening of life. This 
knocks you down, and you must grope for a new path, since the 
light in that joyful fire has completely gone out for you. Or your 
joy tears your neighbor away and throws him off course, since life 
is like a great fire that torches everything in its vicinity: But fire is 
the element of the devil 

‘When I saw that the devil is joy, surely I would have wanted to 
make a pact with him. But you can make no pact with joy, because 
it immediately disappears. Therefore you cannot capture the devil 
either. Yes, it belongs to his essence that he cannot be captured. He 
is stupid if he lees himself be caught, and you gain nothing from 
having yet one more stupid devil. The devil always seeks to saw 
off the branch on which you sit. That is useful and protects you 
from falling asleep and from the vices that go along with it. 

The devil is an evil element. But joy? If you run after it, you 
see that joy also has evil in it, since then you arrive at pleasure and 
from pleasure go straight to Hell, your own particular Hell, which 
turns out differently for everyone. 

Through my coming to terms with the devil, he accepted 
some of my seriousness, and I accepted some of his joy. This gave

me courage. But if the devil has gotten more earnest, one must 
brace oneself” It is always a risky thing to accept joy, but it leads 
us to life and its disappointment, from which the wholeness of 
our life becomes.* 


The Castle in the Forest” 


Cap ii 


[HI 5] "In the second night thereafter, I am walking alone 
in a dark forest and I notice that I have lost my way" Lam on a 
dark care track and stumble through the darkness. I finally come to 
«quiet, dark swamp water, and a small old castle stands a its center 
I think it would be good to ask here for the night’s lodgings. 1 
knock on the door, I wait a long time, it begins to rain. I have 
to knock again, Now I hear someone coming: the door opens. A 
man in an old fashioned garment, a servant, asks what I want. I ask 
about lodgings for the night, and he lets me enter a dark vestibule. 
Then he leads me up an old, worn-out stairway. At the top I come 
to a wider and higher hall-like space with white walls, ined with 
black chests and wardrobes 

1am led into a kind of reception room. It is a simple space 
with old upholstered furniture. The dim light of an antiquated 
lamp lights the room only very meagerly: The servant knocks on a 
side door and then quietly opens it.I scan it swiftly: it’s a scholar’s 
study, with bookshelves on all four walls and a large writing desk, 
at which an old man sits wearing a long black robe. He beckons 
me to draw closer. The air in the room is heavy and the old man 
seems careworn, He is not without dignity—he seems to be one 
of those who have as much dignity as one can be granted. He has 
that modest-fearful look of scholarly men who have long since 
been squashed to nothing by the abundance of knowledge. I think 
that he is a real / scholar who has learned great modesty before 
the immensity of knowledge and has given himself tirelessly 
to the material of science and research, anxiously and equably 
appraising, as if he personally had to represent the working out 
of scientific truth. 

He greets me embarrassed, as ifabsent and defensive. I do not 
wonder about this since I look like an ordinary person. Only with 
difficulty can he turn his gaze away from his work. I repeat my 
request for lodgings for the night. After a longer pause the old man 
remarks, "So, you want to sleep, then please yourself” I notice that 
he is absentminded, and therefore ask him to instruct the servant 
to show me a chamber: To this he says, “You are demanding, wait, 
1 cannot just drop everything!” He sinks again into his book. I wait 
patiently. After'a while he looks up astonished: “What do you want 
here? Oh—forgive me—I totally forgot that you are waiting here. 
T'll call the servant straightaway.” The servant comes and leads me 
to a small chamber on the same floor with bare white walls and a 
large bed. He wishes me good night and withdraws. 

‘As I am tired, I undress immediately and go to bed, after I 
have snuffed out the candle, The sheet is uncommonly rough and 
the pillow hard, My errant way has led me to a strange place: a 
small old castle whose scholaly owner is apparently spending the 
evening of his life alone with his books. No one else seems to be 
living in the house apart from the servant who lives over there

in the tower. An ideal though solitary existence, I think, this life 
of the old man with his books. And here my thoughts linger for 
a long time, until I finally notice that another thought doesn’t 
let go of me, namely that the old man has hidden his beautiful 
daughter here—a vulgar idea for a novel—an insipid, worn-out 
theme—but the romantic can be felt in every limb—a real novelistic 
idea—a castle in a forest—solitary night—an old man petrified 
in his books, protecting a costly treasure and enviously hiding it 
from all the world—what ridiculous thoughts come to me! Is it 
Hell or purgatory that I must also contrive such childish dreams 
on my wanderings? But I feel impotent to elevate my thoughts 
to something a bit stronger or more beautiful. I suppose I must 
allow these thoughts to come, What good would it do to push 
them away—they will come again—better to swallow this stale 
dink than keep it in the mouth, So what does this boring heroine 
look like? Surely blonde, pale—blue eyes—hoping longingly that 
every lost wanderer is her savior from the paternal prison—Oh, I 
know this hackneyed nonsense—T'd rather sleep—why the devil 
must I plague myself with such empty fantasies? 

Sleep does not come. I toss and turn—sleep still does not 
‘come—miust I finally harbor this unsaved soul in myself? And is 
ie this that will not let: me sleep? Have I such a novelistic soul? 
That's all I needed—this would be agonizingly ridiculous. 
Does this bitterest of all drinks never end? It must already 
be midnight—and still sleep does not come, What in the wide 
world, then, won't let me sleep? Is it something to do with this 
chamber? Is the bed bewitched? It’s terrible, what sleeplessness 
can drive a man to—even the most absurd and superstitious 
theories. It seems to be cool, I'm freezing—perhaps that's what 
keeps me from sleeping—it’s really uncanny here—Heaven knows 
what goes on here—weren’t those steps just now? No, that must 
have been outside—I roll over, firmly closing my eyes, I simply 
must sleep. Wasn't that the door just now? My God, someone 
is standing there! Am I seeing straight?—a slim girl, pale as 
death, standing at the door? For Heaven's sake, what is this? She's 
coming nearer! 

“Have you come at last?" she asks quietly: Impossible—this is a 
cruel mistake—the novel wants to become real—does it want to 
grow into some silly ghost story? To what nonsense am I damned? 
Is it my soul that harbors such novelistic brilliance? Must this, 
too, happen to me? I am truly in Hell—the worst awakening after 
death, to be resurrected in a lending library! Have I held the men 
of my time and their taste in such contempt that I must live in 
Hell and write out the novels that I have already spat on long ago? 
Does the lower half of average human taste also claim holiness 
and invulnerability, so that we might not say any bad word /about 
it without having to atone for the sin in Hell? 

She says, “Oh, s0 you too think me common? Do you too let 
yourself be deluded by the wretched delusion that I belong in a 
novel? You as well, whom I hoped had thrown off appearances 
and striven after the essence of things?” 

1: “Forgive me, but are you real? It's the sorriest likeness to those 
foolishly threadbare scenes in novels for me to assume that you 
are not simply some unfortunate product of my sleepless brain. Is 
my doubt then truly confirmed by a situation that conforms so 
thoroughly with a sentimental romance?” 

She: "You wretch, how can you doubt that I am real?” 








She falls to her knees at the foot of my bed, sobbing and 
holding her face in her hands, My God, in the end is she really rea, 
and do I do her an injustice? My pity awakens. 

I: “But for Heaven's sake, tell me one thing: in all earnestness 
must I assume that you are real?” 

She weeps and does not answer. 

1: “Who are you, then?” 

She: “I am the old man’s daughter. He holds me here in 
unbearable captivity, not out of envy or hate, but out of love, since 
Tam his only child and the image of my mother. who died young” 

1 scratch my head: is this not some hellish banality? Word for 
word, pulp fiction from the lending library! Oh you Gods, where 
have you led me? Ir’s enough to make one laugh, it’s enough 
to make one weep—to be a beautiful sufferer, a tragic shattered 
person is difficult, but to become an ape, you beautiful and great 
ones? To you the banal and eternally ridiculous, the unutterably 
hackneyed and emptied out, is never set like a gift of Heaven in 
uplifted praying hands. 

But stll she lies there, erying—yet what if she were real? Then 
she would be worth feeling sorry for, every man would have 
compassion for her. If she is a decent giel, what must it have cost 
her to enter into the rom of a strange man! And to overcome her 
shame in this way? 

1: “My dear child, I believe you, despite everything, chat you 
are real, What can I do for you?” 

She; “Finally, finally a word from a human mouth!” 


She gets up, her face beaming, She is beautiful. A deep purity 
rests in her look. She has a beautiful and unworldly soul, one 
that wants to come into the life of reality, to all reality worthy 
of pity to the bath of filth and the well of health, Oh this beauty 
of the soul! To see it climb down into the underworld of reality— 
what a spectacle! 

She: “What can you do for me? You have already done much 
for me. You spoke the redeeming word when you no longer placed 
the banal between you and me. Know then: I was bewitched by 
the banal” 

I: “Woe is me, you now become very fairy-tale-like.” 

She: “Be reasonable, dear friend, and do not stumble now 
over the fabulous, since the fairy tale is the great mother of the 
novel, and has even more universal validity than the most-avidly 
read novel of your time. And you know that what has been 
on everyone's lips for millennia, though repeated endlessly, still 
comes nearest the ultimate human truth. So do not let the fabulous 
come between us.” 

I:"You are clever and do not seem to have inherited the wisdom 
of your father. But tell me, what do you think of the divinity, of 
the so-called ultimate truths? I found it very strange to seek them in 
banality. According to their nature, they must be quite uncommon. 
Think only of our great philosophers.” 

She: “The more uncommon these highest truths are, the more 
inhuman must they be and the less they speak to you as something 
valuable or meaningful concerning human essence and being 
Only what is human and what you call banal and hackneyed / 
contains the wisdom that you seek. The fabulous does not speak 
against me but for me, and proves how universally human I am 
and how much I too not only need redemption but also deserve

it, For I can live in the world of reality as well or better than many 
others of my sex.” 

I; “Strange maiden, you are bewildering—when I saw your 
father, I hoped he would invite me to a scholarly conversation. 
He did not, and I was aggrieved at him because of this, since his 
distracted slackness hurt my dignity. But with you I find it much 
better. You give me matters to ponder. You are uncommon.” 

She: “You are mistaken, I am very common.” 

1:"I can’t believe that. How beautiful and worthy of adoration 
is the expression of your soul in your eyes. Happy and enviable is 
the man who will free you.” 

She: “Do you love me?” 

I: “By God, I love you—but—unfortunately I am already 
married,” 

She:“So—you see: even banal reality isa redeemer. I thank you, 
dear friend, and I bring you greetings from Salome.” 

With these words her shape dissolves into darkness. Dim 
moonlight penetrates the room. Where she stood something 
shadowy lies—it is a profusion of red roses. 


[2] “IF no outer adventure happens to you, then no inner 
adventure happens to you either, The part that you take over 
from the devil—joy, that is—leads you into adventure. In this way 
you will find your lower as well as your upper limits, It is necessary 
for you to know your limits. If you do not know them, you run 
into the artificial barriers of your imagination and the expectations 
of your fellow men. But your life will not take kindly to being 
hemmed in by artificial barriers, Life wants to jump over such 
barriers and you will fll out with yourself. These barriers are not 
your real limits, but arbitrary limitations that do unnecessary 
violence to you. Therefore try to find your real limits. One never 
knows them in advance, but one sees and understands them only 
when one reaches them. And this happens to you only if you have 
balance. Without balance you transgress your limits without noticing 
‘what has happened to you. You achieve balance, however, only ifyou 
nurture your opposite. But that is hateful to you in your innermost 
core, because itis not heroic. 

My spirit reflected on everything rare and uncommon, it pried 
its way into unfound possibilities, toward paths that lead into the 
hidden, toward lights that shine in the night. And as my spisit did 
this, everything ordinary in me suffered harm without my noticing 
it, and it began to hanker after life, since I did not live it. Hence 
this adventure, I was smitten by the romantic. The romantic is a 
step backward. To reach the way, one must sometimes also take a 
few steps backward. 

In the adventure I experienced what I had witnessed in the 
Mysterium, What I saw there as Salome and Elijah became in life 
the old scholar and his pale, locked-up daughter. What I live is a 
distorted likeness of the Mysterium. Following the romantic way 
1 reached the awkwardness and ordinariness of life, where I run 
out of thoughts and almost forget myself. What I formerly loved 


‘THE CASTLE IN THE FOREST | 263 


1 must now experience as feeble and wasted, and what I formerly 
derided I had to envy as towering and helplessly crave. I accepted 
the absurdity of this adventure. No sooner had this happened 
than I also saw how the maiden transformed herself and signified 
an autonomous meaning, One inquires into the desire of the 
ridiculous, and that is enough for it to change. 

What about masculinity? Do you know how much femininity 
‘man lacks for completeness? Do you know how much masculinity 
‘woman lacks for completeness? You seek the feminine in women 
and the masculine in men, And thus there are always only men 
and women. But where are people? You, man, should not seek 
the feminine in women, but seek and recognize it in yourself, as 
you / possess it from the beginning. It pleases you, however, to 
play at manliness, because it travels on a well-worn track. You, 
woman, should not seek the masculine in men, but assume the 
‘masculine in yourself, since you possess it from the beginning. But 
it amuses you and is easy to play at femininity, consequently man 
despises you because he despises his femininity. But humankind is 
masculine and feminine, not just man or woman, You can hardly 
say of your soul what sex itis. But if you pay close attention, you 
will see that the most masculine man has a feminine soul, and the 
‘most feminine woman has a masculine soul. The more manly you 
are, the more remote from you is what woman really i, since the 
feminine in yourself is alien and contemptuous. 

If you take a piece of joy from the devil and set off on 
adventures with it, you accept your pleasure, But pleasure 
immediately attracts everything you desire, and then you 
must decide whether your pleasure spoils or enhances you. If 
you are of the devil, you will grope in blind desire after the 
‘manifold, and it will lead you astray. But if you remain with 
yourself, as a man who is himself and not of the devil, then 
you will remember your humanity. You will not behave toward 
women per se as a man, but as a human being, that is to say, 
if you were of the same sex as her. You will recall your femininity. 
It may seem to you then as if you were unmanly, stupid, and 
feminine so to speak. But you must accept the ridiculous, 
otherwise you will suffer distress, and there will come a time, 
when you are least observant, when it will suddenly round on 
you and make you ridiculous. Itis bitter for the most masculine 
man to accept his femininity, since it appears ridiculous to him, 
powerless and tawdry. 

Yes, it seems as if you have lost all virtue, as if you have fallen 
into debasement, It seems the same way to the woman who 
accepts her masculinity” Yes, it seems to you like enslavement. 
‘You are a slave of what you need in your soul. The most masculine 
man needs women, and he is consequently their slave, Become a 
woman yourself* and you will be saved from slavery to woman, 
You are abandoned without mercy to woman so long as you 
cannot fend off mockery with all your masculinity It is good for 
you once to put on women’s clothes: people will laugh at you, but 
through becoming a woman you attain freedom from women and

their tyranny. The acceptance of femininity leads to completion. 
‘The same is valid for the woman who accepts her masculinity 

The feminine in men is bound up with evil. I find it on the 
way of desire, The masculine in the woman is bound up with 
evil. Therefore people hate to accept their own other. But if you 
accept it, that which is connected with the perfection of men comes 
to pass: namely, that when you become the one who is mocked, 
the white bird of the soul comes flying, It was far away, but your 
humiliation attracted it” The mystery draws near to you, and 
things happen around you like miracles. A gold luster shines, since 
the sun has risen from its grave. As aman you have no soul, since it 
is in the woman; as awoman you have no soul, since itis in the man. 
Buc if you become a human being, then your soul comes to you. 

If you remain within arbitrary and artificially created 
boundaries, you will wal as berween two high walls: you do 
not see the immensity of the world. But if you break down the 
walls that confine your views and if the immensity and its endless 
uncertainty inspire you with fear, then the ancient sleeper awak- 
ens in you, whose messenger is the white bird. Then you need the 
message of the old tamer of chaos. There in the whirl of chaos 
dwells eternal wonder. Your world begins to become wonderful 
Man belongs not only to an ordered world, he also belongs in 
the wonder-world of his soul. Consequently you must make your 
ordered world horrible, so that you are put off by being too much 
outside yourself, 

Your soul is in great need, because drought weighs on its 
world. If you look outside yourselves, you see the far-off forest 
and mountains, and above them your vision climbs to the realms 
of the stars. And if you look into yourselves, you will see on the 
other hand the nearby as far-off and infinite, since the world 
of the inner is as infinite as the world of the outer. Just as you 
become a part of the manifold essence of the world through your 
bodies, so you become a part of the manifold essence of the inner 
world through your soul, This inner world is truly infinite, in no 
way poorer than the outer one. Man lives in two worlds. A fool 
lives here or there, but never here and there. 

Perhaps you think that a man who consecrates his life to 
research leads a spiritual life and that his soul lives in / larger 
measure than anyone else's. But such a life is also external, just 
as external as the life of a man who lives for outer things. To be 
sure, such a scholar does not live for outer things but for outer 
thoughts—not for himself, but for his object. If you say of a man 
that he has totally lost himself to the outer and wasted his years 
in excess, you must also say the same of this old man, He has 
thrown himself away in all the books and thoughts of others. 
Consequently his soul isin great need, it must humiliate itself and 
run into every stranger's room to beg for the recognition that he 
fails to give her 

‘Therefore you see those old scholars running after recognition 
in a ridiculous and undignified manner. They are offended if their 
name is not mentioned, cast down if another one says the same 
thing in a better way, irreconcilable if someone alters theirs views 
in the least, Go to the meetings of scholars and you will see them, 
these lamentable old men with their great merits and their starved 


souls famished for recognition and their thirst which can never be 
slaked. The soul demands your folly, not your wisdom. 

Therefore, because I rise above gendered masculinity and yet 
do not exceed the human, the feminine that is contemptible to 
me transforms itself into a meaningful being. This is the most 
difficult thing—to be beyond the gendered and yet remain within 
the human. If you rise above the gendered with the help of a 
general rule, you become the same as that rule and overreach the 
human, Therefore you become dry, hard, and inhuman, 

‘You may go past the gendered for human reasons, and never 
for the sake of a general rule that remains the same in the most 
diverse situations, and therefore never has a perfect validity for 
cach single situation, IF you act from your humanity, you act from 
that particular situation without general principle, with only what 
corresponds to the situation, Thus you do justice to the situation, 
perhaps at the expense of a general rule. That should not be to0 
painful for you, because you are not the rule. There is something 
else that is human, something all too human, and whoever has 
ended up there will do well to remember the blessing of the 
general rule.® For the general rule also has meaning and has not 
been set up for fun. It comprises much venerable work of the 
hhuman spirit. Such persons are not capable of a general principle 
above the gendered, but only their imagination is capable of what 
they have lost. They have become their own imagination and 
arbitrariness, o their own detriment. They need to remember the 
gendered, so that they wake from their dreams to reality. 

It is as agonizing as a sleepless night to fulfill the beyond 
from the here and now, namely the other and the opposing in 
myselE. It sneaks up like a fever, ike a poisonous fog, And when 
your senses are excited and stretched to the utmost, the daimonic 
comes as something so insipid and worn out, so mild and stale, 
that it makes you sick. Here you would gladly stop feeling across 
to your beyond, Startled and disgusted, you long for the return of 
the supernal beauties of your visible world, You spit out and curse 
everything that lies beyond your lovely world, since you know 
that itis the disgust, scum, refuse of the human animal who stuffs 
himself in dark places, creeps along sidewalks, sniffs out every 
blesséd angle, and from the cradle to the grave enjoys only what 
has already been on everyone's lips. 

But here you may not stop—do not place your disgust between, 
your here-and-now and your beyond. The way to your beyond 
leads through Hell and in fact through your own wholly particular 
Hell, whose bottom consists of knee-deep rubble, whose air is the 
spent breath of millions, whose fires are dwarflike passions, and 
whose devils are chimerical sign-boards 

Everything odious and disgusting is your own particular Hell. 
How can it be otherwise? Every other Hell was at least worth 
seeing or full of fun. But that is never Hell. Your Hell is made 
up of all the things that you always ejected from your sanctuary 
with a curse and a kick of the foot. When you step into your 
own Hell, never think that you come like one suffering in 
beauty, or as a proud pariah, but you come like a stupid and 
curious fool and gaze in wonder at the scraps that have fallen 
from your table.* /

You really want to rage, but you see at the same time how well 
rage suits you. Your hellish absurdity stretches for miles. Good 
for you if you can swear! You will find that profanity is lifesaving, 
Thus if you go through Hell, you should not forget to give due 
attention to whatever crosses your path, Quietly look into everything 
that excites your contempt or rage; thereby you accomplish the 
miracle that I experienced with the pale maiden, You give soul to 
the soulless, and thereby it can come to something out of horrible 
nothingness. Thus you will redeem your other into life. Your values

ahead of and beyond yourself. Your being, however, pulls you 
to the bottom like lead. You cannot at the same time live both, 
since both exclude each other. But on the way you can live both. 
Therefore the way redeems you, You cannot at the same time be

mountain to valley and from valley to mountain. Much begins 
amusingly and leads into the dark. Hell has levels”

[HI 11] In the following night,® I found myself wandering 
once more, in a homely, snow-covered country. A gray evening sky 
covers the sun. The air is moist and frosty. Someone who does not 
ook trustworthy has joined me. Most notably, he has only one eye 
and a few scars on his face. He is poor and dirtily clothed, a tramp. 
He has a black stubble beard that has not seen a razor for a long 
time. I have a good walking stick for any eventuality. “Ie’s damned 
cold” he remarks after a while, I agree. After a longer pause he 
asks: “Where are you going?” 

1I:“T'm going to the next village, where I plan to stay overnight.” 

He: “Ti like to do that too, but will hardly manage to get a bed.” 

I: “Have you no money? Well, let us see. Are you out of work?” 

He: “Yes, times are bad. Until a few days ago, I was working for 
a locksmith. But then he had no more work. Now I’m traveling 
and looking for work.” 

I:"Wouldn’t you work for a farmer? There is always a shortage 
of farm labor.” 

“He: “Working for a farmer doesn't suit me. That means getting 
up early in the morning—the work is hard and wages are low.” 

1: “But it’s always much more beautiful in the country than in 
a town.” 

He: “It’s boring in the country, one meets nobody” 

I: "Well, but there are also villagers.” 

He; “But there is no mental stimulation, the farmers are clods.” 

Tlookathim astonished. What, he still wants mental stimulation? 
Better that he honestly earn his keep, and when he has done that 
he can think of stimulation. / 

I: “But tell me, what kind of mental stimulation is there in 
the city?” 

He: “You can go to the cinema in the evenings. That's great and 
cheap. You get to see everything that happens in the world”

have to think of Hell, where there are also cinemas for those 
‘who despised this institution on earth and did not go there because 
everyone else found it to their taste. 

I: "What interested you most about the cinema?” 

He: “One sees all sorts of stunning feats. There was one man 
who ran up houses. Another carried his head under his arm. 
Another even stood in the middle of a fire and wasn't burnt. Yes, 
it’s really remarkable, the things that people can do.” 

‘And that’s what this fellow calls mental stimulation! But 
wait—that does seem remarkable: didn’t the saints also carry 
their heads under their arms?* Didn't Saint Francis and Saint 
Ignatius levitate—and what about the three men in the fiery 
furnace?” Isn't it a blasphemous idea to consider the Acta Sanctorum 
as historical cinema? Oh, today’s miracles are simply somewhat less 
mythical than technical. I regard my companion with feeling—he 
lives the history of the world—and I? 

1: “Certainly, it’s very well done. Did you see anything else 
like this?” 

He: “Yes, I saw how the King of Spain was murdered.” 

I: “But he wasn’t murdered at all.” 

He: “Well, that doesn’t matter; in that case it was one of those 
damned capitalist kings. At least they got one of them. If all of 
them were taken out, the people would be free.” 

Not a word more dare I say: Wilhelm Tell, a work by Friedrich 
Schiller—the man is standing right in the thick of it, in the stream 
of heroic story. One who announces the murder of the tyrant to a 
sleeping people.” 

We have arrived at the inn, a country tavern—a reasonably clean 
parlor—a few men sit with beer in the corner. I am recognized as a 
“gentleman” and led into the better corner where a chequered cloth 
covers the end of a table. The other sits down at the far end of the 
table, and I decide to have him served a proper evening meal, He 
is already looking at me full of expectation and hunger—with his 
one eye. 

I: “Where did you lose your eye?” 

He: “In a brawl. But I also got my knife into the other fellow 
pretty nicely: After that he got three months. They gave me 
six. But it was beautiful in prison, At the time the building was 
completely new: I worked in the locksmith’s, There wasn’t much to 
do and yet there was enough to eat. Prison really isnt al chat bad.” 

T look around to make sure that no one is listening to me 
talking with a former convict, But no one seems to have noticed. 
T seem to have ended up in well-to-do company. Are there also 
prisons in Hell for those who never saw the inside of one while 
they were alive? Incidentally —mustn' it be a peculiarly beautiful 
feeling to hit bottom in reality at least once, where there is no 
going down any further, but only upward beckons at best? Where 
for once one stands before the whole height of reality? 

He; “So after that there I was, out on the street, since they 
banished me. Then I went to France. It was lovely there.” 

‘What demands beauty makes! Something can be learned from 
this man, 

I: “Why did you have this brawl?”

He; “It was over a woman. She was carrying his bastard but I 
wanted to marry her. She was already due. After that she didn't 
want to anymore. I haven't heard from her.” 

I: “How old are you now?” 

He: “Til be thirty-five in spring. Once I find a proper job 
we can get married right off. I'll find myself one, I will. There's 
something wrong with my lungs, though. But that'll soon get 
better again.” 

/ Fle has a coughing fit I think that the prospects are not good 
and silently admire the poor devil's unswerving optimism, 

After dinner I go to bed in a humble room. I hear how the 
other settles into his lodging for the night next door. He coughs 
several times. Then he falls still. Suddenly 1 awaken again at an 
uncanny moan and gurgle mixed with a half-stifled cough. I listen 
tensely—no doubt, it’s him. It sounds like something dangerous. 
1 jump up and throw something on. I open the door of his room. 
Moonlight floods it. The man lies still dressed on a sack of straw. 
A dark stream of blood is flowing from his mouth and forming a 
puddle on the floor. He moans half choking and coughs out blood. 
He wants to get up but sinks back again—I hurry to support him 
but I see that the hand of death lies on him. He is sullied with 
blood twice over. My hands are covered with it, A rattling sigh 
escapes from him. Then every stiffness loosens, a gentle shudder 
passes over his limbs. And then everything is deathly still, 

‘Where am I? Are there also cases of death in Hell for those 
who have never thought about death? I look at my bloodstained 
hands—as if I were a murderer. .. Is it not the blood of my brother 
that sticks to my hands? The moon paints my shadow black on 
the white walls of the chamber. What am I doing here? Why this 
horrible drama? I look inquiringly at the moon as a witness, How 
does this concern the moon? Has it not already seen worse? Has 
it not shone a hundred thousand times into broken eyes? This 
is certainly of no avail to its eternal craters—one more of less. 
Death? Does it not uncover the terrible deceit of life? Therefore 
it is probably all the same to the moon, whether and how one 
passes away. Only we kick up a fuss about it—with what right? 

“What did this one do? He worked, lazed about, laughed, drank, 
ate, slept, gave his eye for the woman, and for her sake forfeited 
his good name; furthermore, he lived the human myth after a 
fashion, he admired the wonder-workers, praised the death of the 
tyrant, and vaguely dreamed of the freedom of the people. And 
then—then he miserably died—like everyone else. That is generally 
valid. I sat down on the floor. What shadows over the earth! All 
lights gutter out in final despondency and loneliness. Death has 
entered—and there is no one left to grieve. This is a final truth 
and no riddle. What delusion could make us believe in riddles? 


[2] We stand on the spiky stones of misery and death. 

‘A destitute joins me and wants admittance into my soul, and. 
am thus not destitute enough. Where was my destitution when 
1 did not live it? I was a player at life, one who thought earnestly 
about life and lived it easily. The destitute was far away and 
forgotten. Life had become difficult and murkier. Winter kept 
oon going, and the destitute stood in snow and froze. I join myself 
with him, since I need him. He makes living light and easy. He 
leads to the depths, to the ground where I can see the heights. 
Without the depths, I do not have the heights. I may be on the 
heights, but precisely because of that I do not become aware of 
the heights. I therefore need the bottommost for my renewal. If I 
am always on the heights, I wear them out and the best becomes 
atrocious to me. 


Butbecause I do not want to have it, my best becomes a horror to 
me. Because of that I myself become a horror, a horror to myself 
and to others, and a bad spirit of torment. Be respectful and know 
that your best has become a horror, with that you save yourself 
and others from useless torment. A man who can no longer climb 
down from his heights is sick, and he brings himself and others 
to torment. If you have reached your depths, then you see your 
height light up brightly over you, worthy of desire and far-off, 
as if unreachable, since secretly you would prefer not to reach it 
since it seems unattainable to you. For you also love to praise your 
heights when you are low and to tell yourself that you would have 
only left them with pain, and that you did not live so long as you 
missed them. Ie is a good thing that you have almost become the 
other nature that makes you speak this way: But at bottom you 
know that it is not quite true. 

‘At your low point you are no longer distinct from your fellow 
beings. You are not ashamed and do not regret it, since insofar as 
youlive the life of your fellow beings and descend to their lowliness 
/ you also climb into the holy stream of common life, where you 
are no longer an individual on a high mountain, but a fish among 
fish, a frog among frogs. 

Your heights are your own mountain, which belongs to you 
and you alone. There you are individual and live your very own 
life. If you live your own life, you do not live the common life, 
which is always continuing and never-ending, the life of history 
and the inalienable and ever-present burdens and products of the 
hhuman race. There you live the endlessness of being, but not the 
becoming, Becoming belongs to the heights and is full of torment. 
How can you become if you never are? Therefore you need your 
bottommost, since there you are. But therefore you also need 
your heights, since there you become 

If you live the common life at your lowest reaches, then you 
become aware of your self. If you are on your heights, then you 
are your best, and you become aware only of your best, but not 
that which you are in the general life as a being, What one is 
as one who becomes, no one knows. But on the heights, 
imagination is at its strongest. For we imagine that we know 
what we are as developing beings, and even more so, the less 
‘we want to know what we are as beings. Because of that we do 
not love the condition of our being brought low, although or 
rather precisely because only there do we attain clear knowledge 
of ourselves. 

Everything is riddlesome to one who is becoming, but not to 
one who is. He who suffers from riddles should take thought of 
his lowest condition; we solve those riddles from which we suffer, 
but not those which please us. 

To be that which you are is the bath of rebirth, In the depths, 
being is not an unconditional persistence but an endlessly slow 
growth. You think you are standing still like swamp water, but 
slowly you flow into the sea that covers the earth’s greatest deeps, 
and is so vast that firm land seems only an island imbedded in the 
‘womb of the immeasurable sea. 

‘Asa drop in the ocean you take part in the current, ebb and 
flow. You swell slowly on the land and slowly sink back again in 
interminably slow breaths. You wander vast distances in blurred 
currents and wash up on strange shores, not knowing how you 
got there. You mount the billows of huge storms and are swept 
back again into the depths. And you do not know how this 
happens to you. You had thought that your movement came from 
youand that it needed your decisions and efforts, so that you could 
get going and make progress. But with every conceivable effort you

‘would never have achieved that movement and reached those areas 
to which the sea and the great wind of the world brought you. 

From endless blue plains you sink into black depths; luminous 
fish draw you, marvelous branches twine around you from above 
You slip through columns and twisting, wavering, dark-leaved 
plants, and the sea takes you up again in bright green water 
to white, sandy coasts, and a wave foams you ashore and swallows 
you back again, and a wide smooth swell lifts you softly and 
leads you again to new regions, to twisting plants, to slowly 
creeping slimy polyps, and to green water and white sand and 
breaking surf, 

But from far off your heights shine to you above the sea in 
a golden light, like the moon emerging from the tide, and you 
become aware of yourself from afar, And longing seizes you and 
the will for your own movement. You want to cross over from 
being to becoming, since you have recognized the breath of the 
sea, and its flowing, that leads you here and there without your 
ever adhering; you have also recognized its surge that bears you to 
alien shores and carries you back, and gargles you up and down. 

You saw that it was the life of the whole and the death of each 
individual. You felt yourself entwined in the collective death, 
from death to the earth's deepest place, from death in your own 
strangely breathing depths. Oh—you long to be beyond; despair 
and mortal fear seize you in this death that breathes slowly and 
stseams back and forth eternally. All this light and dark, warm, 
tepid, and cold water, all these wavy, swaying, twisting plantlike 
animals and bestial plants, all these nightly wonders become a 
horror to you, and you long for the sun, for light dry air, for firm 
stones, for a fixed place and straight lines, for the motionless and 
firmly held, for rules and preconceived purpose, for singleness 
and your own intent. 

“The knowledge of death came to me that night, from the dying 
that engulfs the world, I saw how we live toward death, how the 
swaying golden wheat sinks together under the scythe of the 
reaper, / like a smooth wave on the sea-beach, He who abides in 
common life becomes aware of death with fear. Thus the fear of 
death drives him toward singleness. He does not live there, but 
he becomes aware of life and is happy, since in singleness he is 
cone who becomes, and has overcome death. He overcomes death 
through overcoming common life. He does not live his individual 
being, since he is not what he is, but what he becomes. 

One who becomes grows aware of life, whereas one who 
simply exists never will, since he is in the midst of life. He needs 
the heights and singleness to become aware of life, But in life he 
becomes aware of death, And it is good that you become aware 
of collective death, since then you know why your singleness 
and your heights are good. Your heights are like the moon that 
luminously wanders alone and through the night looks eternally 
clear. Sometimes it covers itself and then you are totally in the 
darkness of the earth, but time and again it fills itself out with 


THE ANCHORITE | 267 


light. The death of the earth is foreign to it. Motionless and clear, 
it sees the life of the earth from afar, without enveloping haze 
and streaming oceans. Its unchanging form has been solid from 
eternity, It is the solitary clear light of the night, the individual 
being, and the near fragment of eternity. 

From there you look out, cold, motionless, and radiating. With 
otherworldly silvery light and green twilights, you pour out into 
the distant horror. You see it but your gaze is clear and cold. Your 
hands are red from living blood, but the moonlight of your gaze is 
motionless, Its the life blood of your brother, yes, itis your own 
blood, but your gaze remains luminous and embraces the entire 
horror and the earth’s round. Your gaze rests on silvery seas, on 
snowy peaks, on blue valleys, and you do not hear the groaning 
and howling of the human animal. 

“The moon is dead. Your soul went to the moon, to the preserver 
of souls* Thus the soul moved toward death." I went into the 
inner death and saw that outer dying is better than inner death. 
‘And I decided to die outside and to live within, For that reason I 
turned away® and sought the place of the inner life. 


The Anchorite 


Cap. iv. Dies 1 


[HI 15] On the following night, I found myself on new paths; 
hot dry air flowed around me, and I saw the desert, yellow sand 
all around, heaped up in waves, a terrible irascible sun, a sky as 
blue as tarnished steel, the air shimmering above the earth, on my 
right side a deeply cut valley with a dry river bed, some languid 
grass and dusty brambles. In the sand I see the tracks of naked 
feet that lead up from the rocky valley to the plateau. I follow 
them along a high dune. Where it falls off, the tracks move off 
to the other side. They appear to be fresh, and old half-worn-away 
footprints run alongside, I pursue them attentively: again they 
follow the slope of the dune, now they flow into another set of 
foorprints—but it is the same / set that I have already followed, 
the one ascending from the valley. 

Henceforth I follow the footprints downward in astonishment. 
1 soon reach the hot red rocks corroded by the wind, On the 
stone the footprints are lost but I see where the rock falls off 
in layers and I climb down, The air glows and the rock burns 
my soles, Now I have reached the bottom; there are the tracks 
again. They lead along the winding of the valley, a short distance. 
Suddenly I stand before a small hut covered in reeds and made 
of mud bricks. A rickety wooden plank forms the door where a 
cross has been painted in red. I open it quietly: A haggard man 
covered in a white linen mantle is sitting on a mat with his back 
leaning against the wall. Across his knees lies a book in yellow 
parchment, with beautiful black handwriting—a Greek gospel, 
without doubt. I am with an anchorite of the Libyan desert 


40 In Tronfrmaton ond Syebole ofthe Lido (1012), Jung cited beliefs in diferen cleus that che moon was the gathering place of departed souls (CW B, $496).

reached a new word, which had been alien to me previously. I see nether way nor path. What I believed about the soul has to become true here, narly that she knows 
hher own way better, and that no intention can prescribe her a better one, I feel that a large chunk of science has been broken off. | suppose it must be lke this, for che sake

45 In the next chapter, the anchorite is identified a5 Ammonis. Ina letter of December 31, 1913, Jang noted that the anchorite came from the tied century ([FA). 
“There are theee historical figures named Ammonius in Alexandria from this period: Ammonius, a Christian philosopher in the third century, once thought to have been 
responsible for the medieval divisions of the gospels; Ammonius Cetus, who Was born a Christian but turned co Greek philosophy and whose work presents a transition 
from Platonism to Neoplatonism; a Neoplatonic Ammonius in the fifth century, who tried to reconcile Aristotle andthe Bible. Ar Alexandria. there was accommodation 
beween Neoplatonism and Christianity, and some of the pupils of the later Ammonius converted to Christianity.

1: “Am I disturbing you, father?” 

A:"You do not disturb me. But do not call me father. [am aman 
like you. What is your desire?” 

I: “I come without desire, I have come to this place in the 
desert by chance, and found tracks in the sand up there that led 
me in a circle to you.” 

A: "You found the tracks of my daily walks at daybreak 
and sunset.” 

I: “Excuse me if | interrupt your devotion, it is a rare opportunity 
for me to be with you, I have never before seen an anchorite.” 

‘Ac “There are several others whom you can see further down, 
in this alley. Some have huts like me, others live in the graves that 
the ancients have hollowed out in these rocks. I live uppermost in 
the valley, because it is most solitary and quiet here, and because 
here I am closest to the peace of the desert.” 

I; “Have you already been here long?” 

‘A:“Thave lived here for perhaps ten years, but really, I can no 
longer remember exactly how long itis. It could also be a few more 
years. Time passes so quickly.” 

I: “Time passes quickly? How is that possible? Your life must 
be frightfully monotonous.” 

‘A: “Time certainly passes quickly for me. Much too quickly 
even, It seems you are a pagan?” 

I: “Me? No—not exactly. I was raised in the Christian faith.” 

‘A:*Well, then, how can you ask whether time drags on for me? 
‘You must know what preoccupies a man who is grieving. Only 
idlers grow bored.” 

I: “Again, forgive me, my curiosity is great, what then do you 
occupy yourself with?” 

‘A: “Are you a child? To begin with you see that I am reading, 
and than I keep regular hours.” 

1: “But I can see nothing at all with which you could occupy 
yourself here. You must have read this book from cover to cover 
often enough. And ifitis the gospels, as I suppose, then I am sure 
you already know them by heart.” 

A: “How childishly you speak! Surely you know that one can 
read a book many times—perhaps you almost know it by heart, and 
nevertheless it can be that, when you look again at the lines before 
you, certain things appear new or even new thoughts occur to you 
that you did not have before. Every word can work productively in 
your spirit. And finally if you have once left the book for a week 
and you take it up again after your spirit has experienced various 
different changes, then a number of things will dawn on you.” 

I: “I have difficulty grasping this. The book remains one and 
the same, certainly a wonderfully profound, yes, even divine matter, 
but surely not rich enough to fll countless years.” 

As "You are astonishing. How, then, do you read this holy book? 
Do you really always see only one and the same meaning in it? 
Where do you come from? You are truly a pagan.” 

I: “I beg you, please don’t hold it against me if I read like a 
pagan, Let me talk with you. I am here to learn from you. Consider 
me as an ignorant student, which I am in these matters.” 

A: “IF [call you a pagan, don’t take it as an insult, I used to be a 
pagan, too, exactly like you as I / well remember. Therefore how 
can I blame you for your ignorance?” 


1: “Thank you for your patience. But it matters very much to 
me to know how you read and what you take from this book.” 

‘A: “Your question is not easy to answer. It’s easier to explain 
colors to a blind person. You must know one thing above all: a 
succession of words does not have only one meaning. But men 
strive to assign only a single meaning to the sequence of words, 
in order to have an unambiguous language. This striving is 
worldly and constricted, and belongs to the deepest layers of 
the divine creative plan. On the higher levels of insight into 
divine thoughts, you recognize that the sequence of words has 
more than one valid meaning. Only to the all-knowing is it given 
to know all the meanings of the sequence of words. Increasingly 
‘we try to grasp a few more meanings.” 

L-"IfT understand you correctly, you think that the holy writings 
of the New Testament also have a doubleness, an exoteric and an 
esoteric meaning, as a few Jewish scholars contend concerning 
their holy books.” 

‘As"This bad superstition is far from me. I observe that you are 
wholly inexperienced in divine matters.” 

I:“I must confess my deep ignorance about these things. But 
1 am eager to experience and understand what you think about 
the multifaceted meaning of the sequence of words.” 

A: “Unfortunately I am in no position to tell you everything I 
know about it. But at least I will try to make the elements clear to 
you. Because of your ignorance I will therefore begin elsewhere this 
time: What you need to know is that before I became acquainted 
with Christianity, I was a rhetorician and philosopher in the city 
of Alexandria, I had a great throng of students, including many 
Romans, a few barbarians, and also some Gauls and Britons. I 
taught them not only the history of Greek philosophy but also 
the new systems, among them the system of Philo, whom we call 
the Jew He was a clever head, but fantastically abstract, as the 
Jews are wont to be when they devise systems; moreover he was 
a slave of his own words. I added my own, and wove an atrocious 
web of words in which I ensnared not only my listeners, but also 
myself, We rioted terribly among words and names, our own 
miserable creatures, and accorded divine potency to them. Yes, we 
even believed in their reality, and believed that we possessed the 
divine and had committed it to words.” 

I: “But Philo Judeaus, if this is who you mean, was a serious 
philosopher and a great thinker. Even John the Evangelist included 
some of Philo’s thoughts in the gospel.” 

A: “You are right. It is to Philo’s credit that he furnished 
language like so many other philosophers. He belongs to the 
language artists. But words should not become Gods.”” 

1: "T fail to understand you here. Does it not say in the gospel 
according to John: God was the Word. It appears to make quite 
explicit the point which you have just now rejected.” 

‘A: “Guard against being a slave to words. Here is the gospel 
read from that passage where it says: In him was the life, What 
does John say there?”* 

1: “And life was the light of men and the light shines in the 
darkness and the darkness has not understood it. But it became 
a person sent from God, by the name of John, who came as a 
witness and to be a witness of the light. The genuine light, which

bby him; and without him was not any ching made that was made. In him was life and che life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness: and the darkness 
comprehended it not. There was « man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Ligh, that all men through him

illuminates each person, came into the world: He was in the 
world, and the world became through him, and the world did not 
recognize him.—That is what I read here. But what do you make 
of this?” 

A: “I ask you, was this AOTOE [Logos] a concept, a word? It 
was a light, indeed a man, and lived among men. You see, Philo 
only lent John the word so that John would have at his disposal 
the word ‘AOTO®’ alongside the word ‘light’ to describe the son 
of man. John gave to living men the meaning of the AOTOE, but 
Philo gave AOTOE as the dead concept that usurped life, even the 
divine life, Through this the dead does not gain life, and the 
living is killed. And this was also my atrocious error” 

1: "I see what you mean, This thought is new to me and seems 
worth consideration. Until now it always seemed to me / as if it 
were exactly that which was meaningful in John, namely that the 
son of man is the AOTOS, in that he thus elevates the lower to the 
higher spirit, to the world of the AOTOE. But you lead me to see 
the matter conversely, namely that John brings the meaning of 
the AOPOE down to man.” 

‘A: “I learned to see that John has in fact even done the great 
service of having brought the meaning of the AOTOE up to man.” 

I: “You have peculiar insights that stretch my curiosity to the 
utmost. How is that? Do you think that the human stands higher 
than the AOTOE?” 

A: “I want to answer this question within the scope of your 
understanding: if the human God had not become important 
above everything, he would not have appeared as the son in the 
flesh, but in the AOPOE."® 

I: “That makes sense to me, but I confess that this view is 
surprising to me. It is especially astonishing to me that you, a 
Christian anchorite, have come to such views, I would not have 
expected this of you.” 

‘A:‘As I have already noticed, you have a completely false idea 
of me and my essence. Let me give you a small example of my 
preoccupation, I've spent many years alone with the process of 
unlearning, Have you ever unlearned anything?—Well, then you 
should know how long it takes, And I was a successful teacher. 
As you know, for such people to unlearn is difficult or even 
impossible, But I see that the sun has gone down. Soon it will be 
completely dark, Night is the time of silence, I want to show you 
your place for the night. I need the morning for my work, but 
after midday you can come to me again if you like. Then we will 
continue our conversation.” 

He leads me out of the hut, the valley is covered in blue shadows. 
‘The first stars are already glittering in the sky. He leads me around 
the corner of a rock: we are standing at the entrance of a grave 
cutinto the stone, We step in, Not far from the entrance lies a heap 
of reeds covered with mats, Next to it there isa pitcher of water, 
and on a white cloth there are dried dates and black bread. 

‘A: “Here is your place and your supper. Sleep well, and do not 
forget your morning prayer, when the sun rises,” 


[2] The solitary lives in endless desert full of awesome 
beauty. He looks at the whole and at inner meaning, He loathes 
manifold diversity if itis near him, He looks at it from afar in its 
totality. Consequently silvery splendor and joy and beauty cloak 
diversity for him. What is near him must be simple and innocent, 
since close at hand the manifold and complicated tear and break

through the silvery splendos. No cloudiness of the sky, no haze 
or mist is allowed to be around him, otherwise he cannot look 
at the distant manifold in the whole. Consequently the solitary 
loves the desert above all, where everything nearby is simple and 
nothing turbid or blurred lies between him and the far-away. 


The life of the solitary would be cold were it not forthe immense su, 
which makes the air and rocks glow. The sun and its eternal splendor replace 
forthe solitary his own life warmth 

His heart longs forthe sun. 

‘He wanders tothe land ofthe sun. 

He dreams of the flickering splendor ofthe sun ofthe hot red stones spread 
out at midday, ofthe golden hot rays of dry sand. / 

“The solitary seeks the sun and noone else is 0 ready to open his heat as hei 
“Therefore he loves the desert above al, since he loves ts deep stillness, 

He needs litle food since the sun and its glow nourish him. Consequently 
the solitary loves the desert above all since it i a mother to him, giving him 
food and invigorating warmth at regular hours 

In the desert the solitary i relieved of care and therefore turns his whole 
life tthe sprouting garden of his soul, which can flourish only under a hot 
sun, In his garden the delicious re fruit grows that bears swelling sweetness 
under a tight shin 

“You think that the solitary és poor. You do not see that he strolls under 
laden fruit trees and that his hand touches grain a hundredfold. Under dark 
leaves the overfill reddish blossoms swell toward him from abundant buds, 
and the fruit almost bursts with thronging juices. Fragrant resins drip from 
his srees and under his feet thrusting seed breaks open. 

[If the sun sinks onto the plane of these like an exhausted bird, the solitary 
envelops himself and holds his breath. He does not move and is pure expectancy 
suntil the mivacle ofthe renewal of Hight rises in the East. 

Brim delicious expectation isin the solitary." 

The horror ofthe desert and of withered evaporation surround him, and 
you do not understand how the solitary can live. / 

But his ey rests on the garden, and his ear listen tothe source, and his 
hhand touches velvet leaves and fruit, and his breath draws in sweet perfumes 
_from blossom-rich tees. 

He cannot tell you, since the splendor of his garden isso abundant. Fre 
stammers when he speaks of it, and he appears to you to be poor in sprit 
and in life, But his hand does not know where it should reach, in allthis 
indescribable fullness 

He gives you a small insignificant fruit, which has just fallen at his fet. 
It appears worthless to you, but if you consider it, you wall sce that this fruit 
tastes lke a sun which you could not have dreamt of. Tt gives off a perfume 
which confuses your senses and makes you dream of rose gardens and sweet 
‘wine and whispering palm trees. And you hold this one fruit in your hands 
dreaming, and you would Iie the tre in which it grows, the garden in which 
this tree stands, andthe sun which brought forth this garden. 

‘And you yourself want tobe that solitary who strolls with the sun in his 
garden, his gaze resting on pendant flowers and his hand brushing a hundred- 
“fold of grain and his breath drinking the perfume from a thousand roses, 

Dull from the sun and drunk from fermenting wines, you lie down in 
ancient graves, whose walls resound with many voices and many colors of a 
thousand solar yers. 

‘When you grow, then you see everything living again as tt was, And / 
when you sleep, you rest, like everything that was, and your dreams echo 
safily again from distant temple chants. 

You sleep down through the thousand solar years, and you wake up

the wall of your bedchamber. 
You aso see yourself in the totality. 


You sit and lean against the wall, and look at the beautiful, 
riddlesome totality. The Summa® lies before you like a book, and 
an unspeakable greed seizes you to devour it. Consequently you 
lean back and stiffen and sit for a long time, You are completely 
incapable of grasping it. Here and there a light flickers, here and 
there a fruit falls from high trees which you can grasp, here and 
there your foot strikes gold. But what is it, if you compare it with 
the totality, which lies spread out tangibly close to you? You stretch 
out your hand, but it remains hanging in invisible webs. You want 
to see it exactly as it is but something cloudy and opaque pushes 
itself exactly in between, You would like to tear a piece out of it; it 
is smooth and impenetrable like polished steel. So you sink back 
against the wall, and when you have crawled through all the glow- 
ing hot crucibles of the Hell of doubt, you sit once more and lean 
back, and look at the wonder of the Summa that lies spread 
out before you. Here and there a light flickers, here and there a 
fruit falls, For you itis all too little, But you begin to be satisfied 
with yourself, and you pay no attention to the years passing 
away, What are years? What is hurrying time to him that sits 
under a tree? Your time passes like a breath of air and you wait 
foor the next light, the next fruit. 


The writing lies before you and always says the same, if you 
believe in words. But if you believe in things in whose places 
only words stand, you never come to the end. And yet you must 
go an endless road, since life flows not only down a finite path 
but also an infinite one, But the unbounded makes you” anxious 
since the unbounded is fearful and your humanity rebels against 
it, Consequently you seek limits and restraints so that you do not 
lose yourself, tumbling into infinity. Restraint becomes imperative 
for you. You cry out for the word which has one meaning and 
no other, so that you escape boundless ambiguity. The word 
becomes your God, since it protects you from the countless 
possibilities of interpretation. The word is protective magic 
against the daimons of the unending, which tear at your soul and 
‘want to scatter you to the winds, You are saved if you can say at 
last: chat is that and only that. You speak the magic word, and 
the limitless is finally banished, Because of that men seek and 
make words. 

He who breaks the wall of words overthrows Gods and defiles 
temples, The solitary is a murderer. He murders the people, because 
he thus thinks and thereby breaks down ancient sacred walls. He 
calls up the daimons of the boundless. And he sits, leans back, 
and does not hear the groans of mankind, whom the fearful fiery 
smoke has seized. And yet you cannot find the new words if you 
do not shatter the old words. But no one should shatter the old 
words, unless he finds the new word that is a firm rampart against 
the limitless and grasps more life in it than in the old word. A new 
word is a new God for old men. Man remains the same, even if 
you create a new model of God for him. He remains an imitator, 
‘What was word, shall become man, The word created the world 
and came before the world. It lit up like a light in the darkness, 
and the darkness did not comprehend it. And thus the word 


52 Latin for “whole 


should become what the darkness can comprehend, since what 
use is the light if the darkness does not comprehend it? But your 
darkness should grasp the light. 


‘The God of words is cold and dead and shines from afar like 
the moon, mysteriously and inaccessibly. Let the word return to 
its / creator, to man, and thus the word will be heightened in 
man, Man should be light, limits, measure. May he be your fruit, 
for which you longingly reach. The darkness does not compre- 
hend the word, but rather man; indeed, it seizes him, since he 
himself is a piece of the darkness. Not from the word down to 
man, but from the word up to man: that is what the darkness 
comprehends. The darkness is your mother; she behooves rev- 
erence, since the mother is dangerous, She has power over you, 
since she gave birth to you. Honor the darkness as the light, and 
you will illumine your darkness. 


If you comprehend the darkness, it seizes you. It comes over you 
like the night with black shadows and countless shimmering stars. 
Silence and peace come over you if you begin to comprehend the 
darkness. Only he who does not comprehend the darkness fears 
the night. Through comprehending the dark, the nocturnal, the 
abyssal in you, you become utterly simple. And you prepare to 
sleep through the millennia like everyone else, and you sleep down 
into the womb of the millennia, and your walls resound with 
ancient temple chants. Since the simple is what always was. Peace 
and blue night spread over you while you dream in the grave of 
the millennia

[HI 22]°*1 awaken, the day reddens the East. A night, a wonderful 
night in the distant depths of time lies behind me. In what far-away 
space was I? What did I dream? Of a white horse? It seems to me 
as if I had seen this white horse on the Eastern sky over the rising 
sun, The horse spoke to me: What did it say? Ie said: “Hail him 
who is in darkness since the day is over him.” There were four 
white horses, each with golden wings. They led the carriage of the 
sun, on which Helios stood with flaring mane.” I stood down in 
the gorge, astonished and frightened. A thousand black serpents 
crawled swiftly into their holes. Helios ascended, rolling upward 
toward the wide paths of the sky. I knelt down, raised my hands 
suppliantly, and called: “Give us your light, you are flame-curled, 
entwined, crucified and revived: give us your light, your light!” This 
cry woke me. Didn't Ammonius say yesterday evening: “Do not 
forget to say your morning prayer when the sun rises.” I thought 
that pechaps he secretly worships the sun. / 

Outside a fresh morning wind rises. Yellow sand trickles in 
fine veins down the rocks. The redness expands across the sky 
and I see the first rays shoot up to the firmament. Solemn calm 
and solitude on all sides. A large lizard lies on a stone and awaits the 
sun, I stand as if spellbound and laboriously remember everything 
from yesterday, especially what Ammonius said. But what did he 
say? That the sequences of words have many meanings, and that

John brought the AOTOE to man. But that does not sound properly 
Christian, Is he perhaps a Gnostic No, that seems impossible 
to me, since they were really the worst of all the idolators of 
words, as he would probably put it. 

‘The sun—what fills me with such inner exaltation? I should 
not forget my morning prayer—but where has my morning prayer 
gone? Dear sun, I have no prayer, since I do not know how one must 
address you. Have | already prayed to the sun? But Ammonius 
really meant that I should pray t0 God at the break of day. He 
probably does not know—we have no more prayers. How should 
he know about our nakedness and poverty? What has happened 
to our prayers? I miss them here. This must really be because of 
the desert, It seems as if there ought to be prayers here. Is this desert 
so very bad? I think it is no worse than our cities, But why then 
do we not pray there? I must look toward the sun, as if it had 
something to do with this, Alas—one can never escape the age-old 
dreams of mankind. 

What shall Ido this whole long morning? I do not understand 
how Ammonius could have endured this life for even a year. I go 
back and forth on the dried-up river bed and finally sit down on 
aboulder. Before me there are a few yellow grasses. Over there a 
small dark beetle is crawling along, pushing a bal in front of ia 
scarab You dear little animal, are you still roiling away in order 
to live your beautiful myth? How seriously and undiscouraged it 
works! If only you had a notion that you are performing an old 
myth, you would probably renounce your fantasies as we men 
have also given up playing at mythology. 

The unreality nauseates one. What I say sounds very odd in 
this place, and the good Ammonious would certainly not agree 
with it. What am I actually doing here? No, I don’t want to 
condemn him in advance, since I still haven't really understood 
what he actually means. He has a right to be heard. By the way, 
I thought differently yesterday. I was even very thankful to him 
that he wanted to teach me, But I’m being critical once again, 
and superior, and may well learn nothing. His thoughts are not 
that bad at all; they are even good. I don't know why I always 
want to put the man down. 

Dear beetle, where have you gone? I can no longer see you~ 
‘Oh, you're already over there with your mythical ball, These little 
animals stick to things, quite unlike us—no doubt, no change of 
mind, no hesitation. Is this so because they live their myth? 


Dear scarab, my father, T honor you, blesséd be your work—in 
erernity Amen. 

What nonsense am I talking? I'm worshiping an animal— 
that must be because of the desert, It seems absolutely to 
demand prayers 

How beautiful it is here! The reddish color of the stones is 
wonderful; they reflect the glow of hundred thousand past suns— 
these small grains of sand have rolled in fabulous primordial 
‘oceans, over them swam primordial monsters with forms never 
beheld before. Where were you, man, in those days? On this warm 
sand lay your childish primordial animal ancestors, like children 
snuggling up to their mother. 

© mother stone, I love you, I lie snuggled up against your warm body, 
your late child. Blessed be you, ancient mother 
7 Yours és my heart and all glory and power—Amen.

‘What am I saying? That was the desert. How everything 
appears so animated to me! This place is truly terrible. These 
stones—are they stones? They seem to have gathered here 
deliberately. They're lined up like a troop transport. They've 
arranged themselves by size, the large ones stand apart, the small 
ones close ranks and gather in groups that precede the large 
ones. Here the stones form states 

‘Am I dreaming oram I awake? I's hot—the sun already stands 
high—how the hours pass! Truly, the morning is nearly over—and 
how astonishing ithas been! Is it the sun or ist these living stones, 
or is it the desert that makes my head buzz? 

1 go up the valley and before long I reach the hut of the anchorite. 
He is sitting on his mat lost in deep reflection. 

I: “My father, I am here.” 

A: “How have you spent your morning?” 

1: “I was surprised when you said yesterday that time passes 
quickly for you. I don’t question you anymore and this will no 
longer surprise me. I've learned a lot. But only enough to make 
you an even greater riddle than you were before. Why, all the 
things that you must experience in the desert, you wonderful 
man! Even the stones are bound to speak to you.” 

A: “P’m happy that you have learned to understand something 
of the life of an anchorite, That will make our difficult task easier. 
I don’t want to intrude on your mysteries, but I feel that you come 
from a strange world that has nothing to do with mine” 

1: *You speak truthfully: I'm a stranger here, more foreign 
than any you've ever seen. Even a man from Britain's remotest 
coast is closer to you than I am. Therefore have patience, master— 
and let me drink from the source of your wisdom. Although the 
thirsty desert surrounds us, an invisible stream of living water 
flows here.” 

A: “Have you said your prayer?” 

I: “Master, forgive me: I've tried, but I found no prayer. Yet I 
dreamed that I prayed to the rising sun.” 

A:“Don’t worry yourself because of that. Ifyou do find a word, 
your soul has nevertheless found inexpressible words to greet the 
break of day.” 

1: “But it was a heathen prayer to Helios.” 

A: “Let that suffice for you.” 

I: "But Oh master, I've prayed not only to the sun in a dream, 
but in my absentmindedness also to the scarab and the earth,” 

A: “Be astonished at nothing, and in no case condemn or regret 
it. Let us go to work. Do you want to ask something about the 
conversation we had yesterday?” 

I: “T interrupted you yesterday when you spoke of Philo. You 
wanted to explain your notion of the various meanings of particular 
sequences of words.” 

‘A: “Well, I'll continue my account of how I was freed from the 
awful predicament of spinning words. A man my father had set 
free once came to me; this man, whom I'd been attached to since 
my childhood, spoke to me and said: 

“Oh Ammonius, are you well?” “Certainly” I said, “as you 
can see, I am learned and have great success.” 

He; “I mean, are you happy and are you fully alive?" 

I laughed: “As you can see, all is well.”

You wove witty jokes into the lecture to please your listeners, 

You heaped up learnéd expressions to impress them. You 

were restless and hasty as if still compelled to snatch up all 

knowledge. You are not in yoursel£” 

Although these words at first seemed laughable to me, 
they still made an impression on me, and reluctantly I had 
to / credit the old man, since he was right. 

Then he said: “Dear Ammonius, I have delightful 
tidings for you: God has become flesh in his son and has 
brought us all salvation.” “What are you saying.” I called, “you 
probably mean Osiris who shall appear in the mortal body?” 

“No,” he replied, “this man lived in Judea and was 
born from a virgin.” 

I laughed and answered: “I already know about this; 

a Jewish trader has brought tidings of our virgin queen 

to Judea, whose image appears on the walls of one of our 

temples, and reported it as a fairy tale.” 

“No” the old man insisted, “he was the Son of God.” 

“Then you mean Horus, the son of Osiris, don’t you?” 

T answered. 

“No, he was not Horus, but a real man, and he was hung 
from a cross.” 

“Oh, bur this must be Seth, surely, whose punishments 
our old ones have often described.” 

But the old man stood by his conviction and said: “He 
died and rose up on the third day” 

“Well, then he must be Osiris,” I replied impatiently. 

“No,” he cried, “he is called Jesus the anointed one.” 

“Ah, you really mean this Jewish God, whom the poor 
honor at the harbor, and whose unclean mysteries they 
celebrate in cellars.” 

“He was a man and yet the Son of God,” said the old 
man staring at me intently. 

“That's nonsense, dear old man,” I said, and showed 
him to the door. But like an echo from distant rock faces 
the words returned to me: a man and yet the Son of God, It 
seemed significant to me, and this phrase was what brought 
me to Christianity. 

1: "But don’t you think that Christianity could ultimately be a 
transformation of your Egyptian teachings?” 

‘A: “If you say that our old teachings were less adequate 
expressions of Christianity, then I'm more likely to agree with you.” 

1: “Yes, but do you then assume that the history of religions is 
aimed ata final goal?” 

A: “My father once bought a black slave at the market from the 
region of the source of the Nile, He came from a country that had 
heard of neither Osiris nor the other Gods; he told me many things 
in a more simple language that said the same as we believed about 
Osiris and the other Gods. I learned to understand that those 
uneducated Negroes unknowingly already possessed most of 
what the religions of the cultured peoples had developed into 
complete doctrines. Those able to read that language correctly 
could thus recognize in it not only the pagan doctrines but also the 
doctrine of Jesus. And it’s with this that I now occupy myself. 
I read the gospels and seek their meaning whieh is yet to come 


‘We know their meaning as it lies before us, but not their hidden 
meaning which points to the future. It’s erroneous to believe that 
religions differ in their innermost essence. Strictly speaking, its 
always one and the same religion. Every subsequent form of religion 
is the meaning of the antecedent.” 

I: “Have you found out the meaning which is yet to come?” 

‘A: “No, not yet; it’s very difficult, but I hope I'll succeed 
Sometimes it seems to me that I need the stimulation of others, 
but I realize thar those are temptations of Satan.” 

I:"Don'tyou believe that youd succeed if you were nearer men?” 

‘A: “Perhaps you'e right,” 

He looks at me suddenly as if doubeful and suspicious. “But,” 
he continues, “I love the desert, do you understand? This yellow, 
sun-glowing desert. Here you can see the countenance of the sun 
every day, you are alone, you can see glorious Helios—no, that is 
pagan—whar’s wrong with me? I’m confused—you are Satan— 
I recognize you—give way, adversary!”

dead and inanimate betrays a secret life and silent, inexorable 
intent. You have got caught up in a hustle and bustle where 
everything goes its own way with strange gestures, beside you, 
above you, beneath you, and through you: even the stones speak 
to you, and magical threads spin from you to things and from 
things to you, Far and near work within you and you work 
ina dark manner upon the near and the far. And you are always 
helpless and a prey. 

But if you watch closely, you will see what you have never seen 
before, namely that things live their life, and that they live off you: 
the rivers bear your life to the valley, one stone falls upon another 
with your force, plants and animals also grow through you and 
they are the cause of your death, A leaf dancing in the wind dances 
with you; the irrational animal guesses your thought and represents 
you. The whole earth sucks its life from you and everything 
reflects you again. 

Nothing happens in which you are not entangled in a secret 
manner; for everything has ordered itself around you and plays 
your innermost. Nothing in you is hidden to things, no matter 
how remote, how precious, how secret it is. It inheres in things. 
‘Your dog robs you of your father, who passed away long ago, and 
Jooks at you as he did. The cow in the meadow has intuited your 
mother, and charms you with total calm and security. The stars 
whisper your deepest mysteries to you, and the soft valleys of the 
arth rescue you in a motherly womb, 

Like a stray child you stand pitifully among the mighty, who 
hold the threads of your life, You cry for help and attach yourself 
to the first person that comes your way: Perhaps he can advise you, 
perhaps he knows the thought that you do not have, and which all 
things have sucked out of you. 


1 know that you would like to hear the sidings of he whom things have 
not lived, but who lived and fulfilled himself. For you area son of the earth, 
sucked dry by the suckling earth, that can suck nothing out of sel, but sukles 
only from the sun. Therefore you would like to have tidings of the son of the 
sun, which shines and doesnot suckle. 

7 You would like to hear of the son of God, who shone and gave, who 
begot, and to whom life was born again, asthe earth bears the sun green and 
colorfid children 

You would ike t0 hear of him, she radiating savior, who as a son of the 
sun cut through the webs of the earth, who sundered the magic threads and 
released those in bondage, who owned himself and was no one's servant, who 
sucked no one dry, and whose treasure no one exhausted, 

You would like t0 hear of him who was not darkened by the shadow of 
carth, but illuminated t, who sew the thoughts ofall, and whose shoughts 
no one guessed, who possessed in himself the meaning of all things, and whose 
meaning no thing could express 


The solitary fled the world; he closed his eyes, plugged his ears 
and buried himself in a cave within himself, but it was no use. 
The desert sucked him dry, the stones spoke his thoughts, the 
cave echoed his feelings, and so he himself became desert, stone, 
and cave, And it was all emptiness and desert, and helplessness 
and barrenness, since he did not shine and remained a son of the 
earth who sucked a book dry and was sucked empty by the desert. 
He was desire and not splendor, completely earth and not sun

Consequently he was in the desert as a clever saint who very 
well knew that otherwise he was no different from the other sons 
of the earth. If he would have drunk of himself, he would have 
drunk fire, 


“The solitary went into the desert to find himself. But he did 
rot want to find himself, but rather the manifold meaning of holy 
scripture, You can suck the immensity of the small and the great 
into yourself, and you will become emptier and emptier, since 
immense fullness and immense emptiness are one and the same 

He wanted to find what he needed in the outer. But you 
find manifold meaning only in yourself, not in things, since the 
manifoldness of meaning is not something that is given at the 
same time, but is a succession of meanings. The meanings that 
follow one another do not lie in things, but lie in you, who are 
subject to many changes, insofar as you take part in life. Things 
also change, but you do not notice this if you do not change, But 
ifyou change, the countenance of the world alters. The manifold 
sense of things is your manifold sense. It is useless to fathom it 
in things, And this probably explains why the solitary went into 
the desert, and fathomed the thing but not himself. 

‘And therefore what happened to every desirous solitary also 
happened to him: the devil came to him with smooth tongue and 
clear reasoning and knew the right word at the right moment. He 
lused him to his desire. I had to appear to him as the devil, since 
Thad accepted my darkness, I ate the earth and I drank the sun, 
and I became a greening tree that stands alone and grows.°/ 


Death* 


Cap. vi. 


[HI 29] On the following night, I wandered to the northern 
land and found myself under a gray sky in misty-hazy cool-moist 
air, I strive to those lowlands where the weak currents, flashing in 
broad mirrors, stream toward the sea, where all haste of flowing 
becomes more and more dampened, and where all power and all 
striving unites with the immeasurable extent of the sea. The trees 
become sparse, wide swamp meadows accompany the still, murky 
water, the horizon is unending and lonely, draped by gray clouds. 
Slowly, with restrained breath, and with the great and anxious 
expectation of one gliding downward wildly on the foam and 
pouring himself into endlessness, I follow my brother, the sea. 
Ie flows softly and almost imperceptibly, and yet we continually 
approach the supreme embrace, entering the womb of the source, 
the boundless expansion and immeasurable depths. Lower yellow 
hills rise there, A broad dead lake widens at their feet. We wander 
along the hills quietly and they open up to a dusky, unspeakably 
remote horizon, where the sky and the sea are fused into infinity 

Someone is standing there, on the last dune. He is wearing 
a black wrinkled coat; he stands motionless and looks into the 
distance. I go up to him—he is gaunt and with a deeply serious 
look in his eyes. I say to him: 

“Let me stand beside you for a while, dark one. I recognized 
you from afar. There is only one who stands this way, so solitary and. 
at the last corner of the world.”

He answered: “Stranger, you may well stand by me, ifit is not 
too cold for you. As you can see, I am cold and my heart has 
never beaten.” 

“I know, you are ice and the end; you are the cold silence of the 
stones; and you are the highest snow on the mountains and the 
most extreme frost of outer space. I must feel this and that’s why 
I stand near you.” 

“What leads you here to me, you living matter? The living are 
never guests here. Well, they all flow past here sadly in dense 
crowds, all those above in the land of the clear day who have taken 
their departure, / never to return again. But the living never come 
here, What do you seek here?” 

“My strange and unexpected path led me here as I happily 
followed the way of the living stream. And thus I found you. I 
gather this is your place, your rightful place?” 

“Yes, here it leads into the undifferentiable, where none is 
equal or unequal, but all are one with one another. Do you see 
what approaches there?” 

“T see something like a dark wall of clouds, swimming toward 
us on the tide.” 

“Look more closely, what do you recognize?” 

“I see densely pressed multitudes of men, old men, women, 
and children. Between them I see horses, oxen and smaller 
animals, a cloud of insects swarms around the multitude, a 
forest swims near, innumerable faded flowers, an utterly dead 
summer. They are already near; how stiff and cool they all 
look, their feet do not move, no noise sounds from their closed 
ranks, They are clasping themselves rigidly with their hands 
and arms; they are gazing beyond and pay us no heed—they are 
all flowing past in an enormous stream, Dark one, this vision 
is awful” 

“You wanted to stay by me, so get hold of yourself. Look!” 

I see: “The first rows have reached the point where the surf 
and the stream flow together violently. And it looks as if a wave 
of air were confronting the stream of the dead together with the 
surging sea, whirling them up high, scattering them in black scraps, 
and dissolving them in murky clouds of mist. Wave after wave 
approaches, and ever new droves dissolve into black air. Dark one, 
tell me, is this the end?” 

“Look!” 

“The dark sea breaks heavily—a reddish glow spreads out in 
it—itis like blood—a sea of blood foams at my feet—the depths 
of the sea glow—how strange I feel—am I suspended by my feet? 
Is it the sea or i it the sky? Blood and fire mix themselves together 
in a ball—red light erupts from its smoky shroud—a new sun 
escapes from the bloody sea, and rolls gleamingly toward the 
uttermost depths—it disappears under my feet” 

T look around me, I am all alone. Night has fallen, What did 
Ammonius say? Night is the time of silence. 

[2] [HI 30] I looked around me and I saw that the solitude 
expanded into the immeasurable, and pierced me with horrible 
coldness. The sun still glowed in me, but I could feel myself 
stepping into the great shadow. I follow the stream that makes its 


70 CF the vision in Ler Primus, ch. 5, “Descent into Hell in the Future,” p. 241 


way into the depths, slowly and unperturbed, into the depths of 
what is to come. 

‘And thus I went out in that night (jt was the second night of 
the year 1914), and anxious expectation filled me, I went out to 
embrace the future. The path was wide and what was to come was 
awful, It was the enormous dying, a sea of blood. From it the new 
sun arose, awful and a reversal of that which we call day. We have 
seized the darkness and its sun will shine above us, bloody and 
burning like a great downfall 

‘When I comprehended my darkness, a truly magnificent night 
came over me and my dream plunged me into the depths of the 
millennia, and from it my phoenix ascended, 


Bur what happened to my day? Torches were kindled, bloody 
anger and disputes crupted. As darkness seized the world, the 
terrible war arose and the darkness destroyed the light of the 
world, since it was incomprehensible to the darkness and good 
for nothing anymore. And so we had to taste Hell. 

I saw which vices the virtues of this time changed into, how 
your mildness became hard, your goodness became brutality, your 
love became hate, and your understanding became madness. 
Why did you want to comprehend the darkness! But you had to 
or else it would have seized you. Happy the man who anticipates 
this geasp. 

Did you ever think of the evil in you? Oh, you spoke of it, you 
mentioned it, and you confessed it smilingly, as a generally human 
vice, or a recurring misunderstanding But did you know / what 
evil is, and that it stands precisely right behind your virtues, that 
itis also your virtues themselves, as their inevitable substance?” 
You locked Satan in the abyss for a millennium, and when the 
millennium had passed, you laughed at him, since he had become 
a children’s fairy tale.” But if the dreadful great one raises his 
head, the world winces. The most extreme coldness draws near, 

‘With horror you see that you are defenseless, and that the 
army of your vices falls powerless to its knees. With the power 
of daimons, you seize the evil, and your virtues cross over to him. 
‘You are completely alone in this struggle, since your Gods have 
become deaf. You do not know which devils are greater, your 
vices, or your virtues. But of one thing you are certain, that virtues 
and vices are brothers. 

™We need the coldness of death to see clearly. Life wants to 
live and to die, to begin and to end. You are not forced to live 
eternally, but you can also die, since there is a will in you for both. 
Life and death must strike a balance in your existence.” Today's 
men need a large slice of death, since too much incorrectness 
lives in them, and too much correctness died in them. What 
stays in balance is correct, what disturbs balance is incorrect. But if 
balance has been attained, then that which preserves itis incorrect 
and that which disturbs it is correct. Balance is at once life and 
death, For the completion of life a balance with death is fitting. 
If I accept death, then my tree greens, since dying increases life 
If I plunge into the death encompassing the world, then my buds 
break open. How much our life needs death!

Joy at the smallest things comes to you only when you have 
accepted death, But if you look out greedily for all that you could 
still live, then nothing is great enough for your pleasure, and the 
smallest things that continue to surround you are no longer a joy. 
Therefore I behold death, since it teaches me how to live 

If you accept death, itis altogether like a frosty night and an 
anxious misgiving, but a frosty night in a vineyard full of sweet 
grapes.” You will soon take pleasure in your wealth. Death ripens. 
One needs death to be able to harvest the fruit. Without death, 
life would be meaningless, since the long-lasting rises again and 
denies its own meaning. To be, and to enjoy your being, you need 
death, and limitation enables you to fulfill your being 


[HI 31] When I see the lamentation and nonsense of the 
earth and consequently enter death with a covered head, then 
everything I see will indeed turn to ice, But in the shadow world 
the other rises, the red sun.” It rises secretly and unexpectedly, 
and my world revolves like a satanic apparition. I suspect blood 
and murder. Blood and murder alone are still exalted, and have 
their own peculiar beauty; one can assume the beauty of bloody 
acts of violence 

But it is the unacceptable, the awfully repulsive, that which 
T have forever rejected that rises in me. For if the wretched- 
ness and poverty of this life ends, another life begins in what is 
opposed to me. This is opposed to such an extent that I cannot 
conceive it. For it is opposed not according to the laws of reason, 
bur thoroughly and according to its own nature. Yes, itis not only 
opposed, but repulsive, invisibly and cruelly repulsive, something 
that takes my breath away, that drains the power from my muscles, 
that confuses my senses, stings me poisonously from behind in 
the heel, and always strikes just where I did not suspect I possessed 
a vulnerable spot.” 

It does not confront me like a strong enemy, manly and 
dangerously, but I perish on a dung heap, while peaceful chickens 
cackle around me, amazedly and mindlessly laying their eggs. A 
dog passes, lifts his leg over me, then trots off calmly. I curse the 
hour of my birth seven times, and if I do not choose to kill myself 
on the spot, I prepare to experience the hour of my second birth, 
“The ancients said: Inter faeces et urinas nascimur.” For three nights I 
‘was assaulted by the horrors of birth, On the third night, junglelike 
laughter pealed forth, for which nothing is too simple. Then life 
began to stir again. /

[HI 32)" "Yer another new adventure occurred: wide meadows 
spread out before me—a carpet of flowers—softhills—a fresh green 
‘wood in the distance. I come across two strange journeymen— 
probably two completely accidental companions: an old monk

and a tall gangly thin man with a childish gait and discolored red 
clothes. As they draw near, I recognize the tall one as the red rider. 
“How he has changed! He has grown old, his red hair has become 
gray; his fiery red clothes are worn out, shabby, poor. And the other? 
He has a paunch and appears not to have fallen on bad times. But 
his face seems familiar: by all the Gods, it's Ammonius! 

‘What changes! And where are these utterly different people 
coming from? I approach them and bid them good day. Both 
look at me frightened and make the sign of the cross. Their 
horror prompts me to look down at myself. I am fully covered 
in green leaves, which spring from my body. I greet them a second 
time, laughing. 


Ammonius exclaims horrified: “Apage, Satanas!"” 

The Red One: “Damned pagan riffrafil” 

I: “But my dear friends, what's wrong with you? I'm the 
Hyperborean stranger, who visited you, Oh Ammonius, in the 
desert And I'm the watchman whom you, Red One, once visited.” 

Ammonius: “I recognize you, you supreme devil. My downfall 
began with you.” 

The Red One looks at him reproachfully and gives him a 
poke in the ribs. The monk sheepishly stops. The Red One turns 
haughtily toward me. 

R “Already at that time I couldn't help thinking that you 
lacked a noble disposition, novwithstanding your hypocritical 
seriousness. Your damned Christian play-act—” 

‘At this moment Ammonius pokes him in the ribs and the 
Red One falls into an embarrassed silence, And thus both stand 
before me, sheepish and ridiculous, and yer pitiabl. 

I: “Wherefrom, man of God? What outrageous fate has led 
you here, let alone in the company of the Red One?” 

A:"Lwould prefer not to tell you, But it does not appear to be 
a dispensation of God that one can escape, So know then that you, 
evil spirit, have done me a terrible deed. You seduced me with / 
your accursed curiosity, desirously stretching my hand after the 
divine mysteries, since you made me conscious at that time that 
I really knew nothing about them. Your remark that I probably 
needed the closeness of men to arrive at the higher mysteries 
stunned me like infernal poison, Soon thereafter I called the 
brothers of the valley together and announced to them that a 
messenger of God had appeared to me—so terribly had you blinded 
me—and commanded me to form a monastery with the brothers 

"When Brother Philetus raised an objection, I refuted him with 
reference to the passage in the holy scriptures where itis said that 
itis not good for man to be alone.* So we founded the monastery, 
near the Nile, from where we could see the passing ships, 

“We cultivated fat fields, and there was so much to do that the 
holy scriptures fell into oblivion, We became voluptuous, and one 
lay I was filled with such terrible longing to see Alexandria again. 
I talked myself into believing that I wanted to visit the bishop 
there. But first I was intoxicated so much by life on the ship, and 
then by the milling crowds on the streets of Alexandria, that I 
became completely lost.

“As in a dream I climbed onto a large ship bound for Italy. 1 
felt an insatiable greed to see the world. I drank wine and saw that 
‘women were beautiful, I wallowed in pleasure and wholly turned 
into an animal. When I climbed ashore in Naples, the Red One 
stood there, and I knew that I had fallen into the hands of evil” 

R: “Be silent, old fool, if I had not been present, you would 
have become an outright pig. When you saw me, you finally 
pulled yourself together, cursed the drinking and the women, and 
returned to the monastery: 

“Now hear my story, damned hobgoblin: I too fell into your 
snare, and your pagan arts also enticed me. After the conversation 
at that time, where you caught me in the fox trap with your 
remark about dancing, I became serious, so serious that I went 
into the monastery, prayed, fasted, and converted myself, 

“In my blindness I wanted to reform the Church liturgy, and 
with the bishop's approval I introduced dancing 

“Lbecame Abbot and, as such, alone had the sole right to dance 
before the altar, like David before the ark of the covenant. But 
little by litle, the brothers also began to dance; indeed, even the 
congregation of the faithful and finally the whole city danced 

“It was terrible. I fled into solitude and danced all day until I 
dropped, but in the morning the hellish dance began again. 

“I sought to escape from myself, and strayed and wandered 
around at night. In the daytime I kept myself secluded, and 
danced alone in the forests and deserted mountains. And thus 
‘gradually I came to Italy. Down there in the south, I no longer felt 
as I had felt in the north; I could mingle with the crowds. Only 
in Naples did I somewhat find my way again, and there I also 
found this ragged man of God. His appearance gave me strength. 
‘Through him I could regain my health, You've heard how he took 
heart from me, too, and found his way again.” 

A:"I must confess I did not fare so badly with the Red One; he's 
a toned-down type of devil.”

although I've developed a deep aversion against the whole 
Christian religion since my experience in the monastery.”

me. Luscious-lewd whores giggled and rustled along the walls, 
wine fumes and kitchen steam and the foolish cackling of the 
human crowd drew near in a cloud. Hot sticky tender hands 
reached out for me, and I was swaddled in the covers of a sick- 
bed. I was born into life from below, and I grew up as heroes do, 
in hours rather than years. And after I had grown up, I found 
myself in the middle land, and saw that it was spring. 


[HI 34] But I was no longer the man I had been, for a 
strange being grew through me. This was a laughing being of 
the forest, a leaf green daimon, a forest goblin and prankster, 
who lived alone in the forest and was itself a greening tree 
being, who loved nothing but greening and growing, who was 
neither disposed nor indisposed toward men, full of mood 
and chance, obeying an invisible law and greening and wilting 
with the trees, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither good nor 
bad, merely living, primordially old and yet completely young, 
naked and yet naturally clothed, not man but nature, frightened, 
laughable, powerful, childish, weak, deceiving and deceived, utterly 
inconstant and superficial, and yet reaching deep down, down 
to the kernel of the world. 

T had absorbed the life of both of my friends; a green tree 
grew from the ruins of the temple. They had not withstood 
life, but, seduced by life, had become their own monkey business. 
They had got caught in the muck, and so they called the living a 
devil and traitor. Because both of them believed in themselves 
and in their own goodness, each in his own way, they ultimately 
became mired in the natural and conclusive burial ground of 
all outlived ideals. The most beautiful and the best, like the 
ugliest and the worst, end up someday in the most laughable 
place in the world, surrounded by fancy dress and led by fools, 
and go horror-struck to the pit of filth.

being cannot be denied, He who believes he is really living his 
ideals, or believes he can live them, suffers from delusions of 
grandeur and behaves like a lunatic in that he stages himself as an 
ideal; but the hero has fallen, Ideals are mortal, so one should 
prepare oneself for their end: at the same time it probably costs you 
your neck. For do you not see that it was you who gave meaning, 
value, and effective force to your ideal? If you have become a 
sacrifice to the ideal, then the ideal cracks open, plays carnival 
with you, and goes to Hell on Ash Wednesday. The ideal is also 
a tool that one can put aside anytime, a torch on dark paths, But 
whoever runs around with a torch by day is a fool. How much 
my ideals have come down, and how freshly my tree greens! 


"When I turned green, they stood there, the sad remains 
of earlier temples and rose gardens, and I recognized with a 
shudder their inner affinity. It seemed to me that they had 
established an indecent alliance. But I understood that this 
alliance had already existed for a long time. At a time when 
1 still claimed that my sanctuaries were of crystal purity, and 
when I compared my friends to the perfume of the roses of 
Persia." both of them formed an alliance of mutual silence

They seemed to scatter, but secretly they worked together. The 
solitary silence of the temple lured me far away from men to 
the supernatural mysteries in which I lost myself to the point 
of surfeit. And while I struggled with God, the devil prepared 
himself for my reception, and tore me just as far to his side. 
There, too, I found no boundaries other than surfeit and disgust. 
1 did not live, but was driven; I was a slave to my ideals ° 

And thus they stood there, the ruins, quarreling with one 
another and unable to reconcile themselves to their common 
misery, Within myself I had become one as a natural being, but 
1 was a hobgoblin” who frightened the solitary wanderer, and 
who avoided the places of men. But I greened and bloomed from 
within myself. I had still not become a man again who carried 
within himself the conflict between a longing for the world and 
a longing for the spirit. I did not live either of these longings, 
bur I lived myself, and was a merrily greening tree in a remote 
spring forest, And thus I learned to live without the world and 
spirit; and I was amazed how well I could live like this. 

But what about men, what about mankind? There they stood, 
the two deserted bridges that should lead across to mankind: 
one leads from above to below, and men glide down on it, which 
pleases them. / The other leads from below to above and mankind 
groans upward on it. This causes them trouble. We drive our 
fellow men to trouble and joy, If I myself do not live, but merely 
climb, it gives others undeserved pleasure. If I simply enjoy 
myself, it causes others undeserved trouble. If I merely live, I 
am far removed from men, They no longer see me, and when 
they see me, they are astonished and shocked. I myself, however, 
quite simply living, greening, blooming, fading, stand like a tree 
always in the same spot and let the suffering and the joy of men 
pass over me with equanimity. And yet I am a man who cannot 
excuse himself from the discord of the human heart 

But my ideals can also be my dogs, whose yapping and 
squabbling do not disturb me, But at least then I am a good and 
a bad dog to men. But I have not yet achieved what should be, 
namely that I live and yetam a man, It seems to be neatly impossible 
to live as a man. As long as you are not conscious of your self you 
can live; but if you become conscious of your self, you fall from 
one grave into another. All your” rebirths could ultimately make 
you” sick. The Buddha therefore finally gave up on rebirth, for 
he had had enough of crawling through all human and animal 
forms After all the rebirths you still remain the lion crawling 
on the earth, the XAMAI AEN [Chameleon], a caricature, one 
prone to changing colors, a crawling shimmering lizard, but 
precisely not a lion, whose nature is related to the sun, who draws 
his power from within himself, who does not crawl around in 
the protective colors of the environment, and who does not 
defend himself by going into hiding. I recognized the chameleon 
and no longer want to crawl on the earth and change colors and

be reborn; instead 1 want to exist from my own force, like the 
sun which gives light and does not suck light, That belongs to the 
earth. I recall my solar nature and would like to rush to my rising. 
But ruins” stand in my way. They say: “With regard to men you 
should be this or that.” My chameleonesque skin shudders. They 
obtrude upon me and want to color me. But that should no longer 
be. Neither good nor evil shall be my masters. I push them aside, 
the laughable survivors, and go on my way again, which leads 
me to the East, The quarreling powers that for so long stood 
between me and myself lie behind me 

Henceforth I am completely alone. I can no longer say to you: 
“Listen!” or “you should,” or “you could,” but now I talk only with 
myself, Now no one else can do anything more for me, nothing 
whatsoever. I no longer have a duty toward you, and you no lon- 
ger have duties toward me, since I vanish and you vanish from 
me. I no longer hear requests and no longer make requests of you. 
I no longer fight and reconcile myself with you, but place silence 
between you and me 

Your call dies away in the distance, and you cannot find my 
footprints. Together with the west wind, which comes from the 
plains of the ocean, I journey across the green countryside, I 
roam through the forests, and bend the young grass. I talk with 
trees and the forest wildlife, and the stones show me the way. 
When I thirst and the source does not come to me, I go to the 
source. When I starve and the bread does not come to me, I 
seek my bread and take it where I find it. I provide no help and 
need no help. If at any time necessity confronts me, I do not 
look around to see whether there is a helper nearby, but I accept 
the necessity and bend and writhe and struggle. I laugh, I weep, 
1 swear, but I do not look around me. 

On this way, no one walks behind me, and I cross no one’s 
path, Iam alone, but I fill my solitasiness with my life. I am man 
‘enough, I am noise, conversation, comfort, and help enough unto 
myself, And so I wander to the far East. Not that I know any- 
thing about what my distant goal might be. I see blue horizons 
before me: they suffice as a goal, I hurry toward the East and my 
rising—I will my rising. / [Image 36]*/

The way leads inevitably between two high rock faces. My feet

path becomes slippery. One-half of the way is white, the other 
black. I step onto the black side and recoil horrified: it is hot

across and onward, and finally the valley widens into a mighty 
rocky basin. A narrow path winds up along vertical rocks to the 
mountain ridge at the top. 

As I approach the top, a mighty booming resounds from the 
other side of the mountain like ore being pounded, The sound 
gradually swells, and echoes thunderously in the mountain, 
‘As I reach the pass, I see an enormous man approach from the 
other side 

“Two bull horns rise from his great head, and a rattling suit 
of armor covers his chest. His black beard is ruffled and decked 
with exquisite stones. The giant is carrying a sparkling double axe 
in his hand, like those used to strike bulls. Before I can recover 
from my amazed fright, the giant is standing before me. I look 
at his face: it is faint and pale and deeply wrinkled. His almond- 
shaped eyes look at me astonished. Horror takes hold of me: this 
is Iedubar, the mighty, the bull-man. He stands and looks at me: 
his face speaks of consuming inner feat, and his hands and knees 
tremble, Izdubar, the powerful bull trembling? Is he frightened? 
1 call out to him: 


“Oh, Iedubar, most powerful, spare my life and forgive me for 
lying like a worm in your path.” 

lz: “I do not want your life. Where do you come from?” 

1: “I come from the West.” 

Iz: “You come from the West? Do you know of the Western 
lands? Is this the right way to the Western lands?” 

I: “I come from a Western land, whose coast washes against 
the great Western sea.” 

Tz: “Does the sun sink in that sea? Or does it touch the solid 
land in its decline?” 

I: “The sun sinks far beyond the sea.” 

Iz: “Beyond the sea? What lies there?” 

I: “There is nothing but empty space there, As you know, the 
earth is round and moreover it turns around the sun.” 

Iz: “Damned one, where do you get such knowledge? So there 
is no immortal land where the sun goes down to be reborn? Are 
you speaking the truth?” 

His eyes flicker with fury and-fear. He steps a thundering 
pace closer. I tremble 

I: “Oh, Izdubar, most powerful one, forgive my presump- 
‘tuousness, but I'm really speaking the truth. I come from a land 
where this is proven science and where people live who travel 
round the world with their ships, Our scholars know through 
‘measurement how far the sun is from each point of the surface 
of the earth, It is a celestial body that lies unspeakably far out in 
unending space.” 

Iz:“Unending—did you say? Is the space of the world unending, 
and we can never reach the sun?” 

I: “Most powerful one, insofar as you are mortal, you can never 
reach the sun.” 

T see him overcome with suffocating fear. 

Tz: “I am mortal—and I shall never reach the sun, and never 
reach immortality?” 

He smashes his axe with a powerful, clanging blow on the rock 

Iz; “Be gone, miserable weapon. You are not much use. How 
should you be of use against infinity, against the eternal void, / 
and against the unreplenishible? There is no one left for you to 
conquer. Smash yourself, what's it worth!” 


(In the West the sun sinks into the lap of glowing clouds in 
bright crimson) 

“So go away, sun, thrice-damned God, and wrap yourself in 
your immortality!” 

(He snatches the smashed piece of his axe from the ground 
and hurls it coward the sun) 

“Here you have your sacrifice, your last sacrifice!” 

He collapses and sobs like a child. I stand shaking and hardly 
dare stir, 

lz: “Miserable worm, where did you suckle on this poison?” 

1: "Oh I2dubar, most powerful one, what you call poison is 
science. In our country we are nurtured on it from youth, and 
that may be one reason why we haven't properly flourished and 
remain so dwarfish. When I see you, however, it seems to me as 
if we are all somewhat poisoned." 

In: “No stronger being has ever cut me down, no monster has 
ever resisted my strength. But your poison, worm, which you have 
placed in my way has lamed me to the marrow. Your magical 
poison is stronger than the army of Tiamat.”*" (He lies as if 
paralyzed, stretched out on the ground.) “You Gods, help, here 
lies your son, cut down by the invisible serpent's bite in his heel. 
Oh, if only I had crushed you when I saw you, and never heard 
your words.” 

1: “Oh Izdubar, great and pitiable one, had I known that my 
knowledge could cut you down, I would have held my tongue 
But I wanted to speak the truth.” 

Tz: “You call poison truth? Is poison truth? Or is truth poison? 
Do not our astrologers and priests also speak the truth? And yet 
theirs does not act like poison.” 

I: “Oh Iedubar, night is falling, and it will get cold up here. 
Shall I not fetch you help from men?” 

Iz: “Let it be, and answer me instead.” 

I: "But we cannot philosophize here, ofall places. Your wretched 
condition demands help.” 

2: "I say to you, let it be. IF should perish this night, so be it. 
Just give me an answer.” 

1: “I'm afraid, my words are weak, if they are to heal.” 

Tz: “They cannot bring about something more grave. 
‘The disaster has already happened. So tell me what you 
know. Perhaps you even have a magic word that counteracts 
the poison.” 

I: “My words, Oh most powerful one, are poor and have no 
magical power.” 

Iz: “No matter, speak!” 

1:"I don’t doubr that your priests speak the truth. Its certainly 
a truth, only it runs contrary to our truth.” 

Iz: "Are there then two sorts of truth?” 

I: “Ie seems to me to be so, Our truth is that which comes to 
us from the knowledge of outer things. The truth of your priests 
is that which comes to you from inner things.” 

1z (half sitting up): “That was a salutary word.” 

1: “T'm fortunate that my weak words have relieved you. Oh, 
if only I knew many more words that could help you. It has now 
grown cold and dark. I'll make a fire to warm us.” 

Tz: “Do that, a it might help.” (I gathered wood and lit a big 
fire) “The holy fire warms me. Now tell me, how did you make a 
fire so swiftly and mysteriously?” 

I:“All I need are matches. Look, they are small pieces of wood

with a special substance at the tip. Rubbing them against the box 
produces fire.” 

Iz: “Phat is astonishing, where did you learn this art?” 

I: “Everyone has matches where I come from. But this is the 
least of it. We can also fly with the help of useful machines.” / 

Iz: “You can fy like birds? If your words did not contain such 
powerful magic, I would say to you, you were lying.” 

I: “I'm certainly not lying. Look, I also have a timepiece, for 
example, which shows the exact time of day” 

12: This is wonderful. It is clear that you come from a strange 
and marvelous land, You certainly come from the blessed Western 
lands. Are you immortal?” 

I: “I—immortal? There is nothing more mortal than we are.” 

Iz: "What? You are not even immortal and yet you understand 
such arts?” 

I: “Unfortunately our science has still not yet sueceeded in 
finding a method against death.” 

lz: “Who then taught you such arts?” 

I: “In the course of the centuries men have made many discoveries, 
through precise observation and the science of outer things.” 

lz: “But this science is the awful magic that has lamed me. How 
can it be that you are still alive even though you drink from this 
poison every day?” 

I: “We've grown accustomed to this over time, because men 
get used to everything. But we're still somewhat lamed. On the 
other hand, this science also has great advantages, as you've seen. 
“What we've lost in terms of force, we've rediscovered many times 
through mastering the force of nature.” 

Iz: “Isn't it pathetic to be so wounded? For my part, I draw my 
own force from the force of nature. I leave the secret force to the 
cowardly conjurers and womanly magicians. If I crush another's 
skull to pulp, that will stop his awful magic.” 

1: "But don't you realize how the touch of our magic has 
worked upon you? Terribly, I chink.” 

Iz: “Unfortunately, you are right.” 

I; “Now you perhaps see that we had no choice. We had to 
swallow the poison of science. Otherwise we would have met the 
same fate as you have: weid be completely lamed, if we encountered 
it unsuspecting and unprepared. This poison is so insurmountably 
strong that everyone, even the strongest, and even the eternal 
Gods, perish because of it, If our life is dear to us, we prefer to 
sacrifice a piece of our life force rather than abandon ourselves to 
certain death.” 

Iz: "I no longer think that you come from the blessed Western 
lands, Your country must be desolate, full of paralysis and 
renunciation. I yearn for the East, where the pure source of our 
life-giving wisdom flows” 

We sit silently at the flickering fire. The night is cold, Izdubar 
‘groans and looks up at the starry sky above. 

Iz: “Most terrible day of my life—unending—so long—so 
long—wretched magical art—our priests know nothing, or else 
they could have protected me from it—even the Gods die, he says. 
Have you no Gods anymore?” 

1: “No, words are all we have.” 

Iz: “But are these words powerful?” 

1: "So they claim, but one notices nothing of this.” 

Tz:"We do not see the Gods either and yet we believe that they 
exist. We recognize their workings in natural events.” 

I: “Science has taken from us the capacity of belief”"*

Iz: “What, you have lost that, too? How then do you live?” 

I: “We live thus, with one foot in the cold and one foot in the 
hot, and for the rest, come what may!” 

1: “You express yourself darkly” 

I: “So it also is with us, it is dark.” 

Jz: “Can you bear it?” 

1: “Not particularly well. I personally don't find myself at ease 
with it. For that reason, I've set out to the East, to the land of the 
rising sun, to seek the light that we lack. Where then does the 
sun rise?” 

lz: “The earth is, as you say, completely round. Thus the sun 
rises nowhere.” 

I:"T mean, do you have the light that we lack?"/ 

Tz: “Look at me: I flourish in the light of the Western world. 
From this you can measure how fruitful this light is, But if you 
come from such a dark land, then beware of such an overpowering 
light. You could go blind just as we all are somewhat blind.” 

“IF your light is as fantastic as you are, then I will be careful.” 

Iz: “You do well by this” 

1:"I long for your truth.” 

Iz: “As I long for the Western lands. I warn you.” 

Silence descends. Ieis late at night. We fall asleep next to the fre. 


[2] [HI 40] I wandered toward the South and found the 
unbearable heat of solitude with myself I wandered toward the 
North and found the cold death from which all the world dies. 1 
withdrew to my Western land, where the men are sich in knowing 
and doing, and I began to suffer from the sun’s empty darkness. 
‘And I threw everything from me and wandered toward the East, 
where the light rises daily. I went to the East like a child. I did not 
ask, I simply waited, 

Cheerful flowery meadows and lovely spring forests hemmed 
my path, But in the third night, the heaviness came. It stood 
before me like a range of cliffs full of sorrowful desolation, and 
everything tried to deter me from following my life’s path. But 
1 found the entrance and the narrow way. The torment was great, 
since it was not for nothing that I had pushed the two dissipated 
and dissolute ones away from me. I unsuspectingly absorb what I 
reject. What I accept enters that part of my soul which I do not 
know; I accept what I do to myself, but I reject what is done to me. 

So the path of my life led me beyond the rejected opposites, 
united in smooth and—alas!—extremely painful sides of the way 
which lay before me. I stepped on them but they burned and 
froze my soles. And thus I reached the other side. But the 
poison of the serpent, whose head you crush, enters you through 
the wound in your heel; and thus the serpent becomes more 
dangerous than it was before. Since whatever I reject is never- 
theless in my nature, I thought it was without, and so I believed 
that I could destroy it. But it resides in me and has only assumed 
a passing outer form and stepped toward me. I destroyed its 
form and believed that I was a conqueror. But I have not yet 
overcome myself 

‘The outer opposition is an image of my inner opposition. 
Once I realize this, I remain silent and think of the chasm 
of antagonism in my soul. Outer oppositions are easy to over- 
come, They indeed exist, but nevertheless you can be united 
with yourself. They will indeed burn and freeze your soles, 
bur only your soles. It hurts, but you continue and look toward 
distant goals

As I rose to the highest point and my hope wanted to look 
‘out toward the East, a miracle happened: as I moved toward the 
East, one from the East hurried toward me and strove toward the 
sinking light. I wanted light, he wanted night, I wanted to rise, he 
‘wanted to sink. I was dwarfish like a child, while he was enormous 
like an elementally powerful hero. Knowledge lamed me, while he 
was blinded by the fullness of the light. And so we hurried toward 
each other; he, from the light; I, from the darkness; he, strong; I, 
‘weak; he, Gods I, serpent; he, ancient; I, utterly new; he, unknowing: 
1, knowing, he, fantastic; I, sober; he, brave, powerful; I, cowardly, 
cunning But we were both astonished to see one another on the 
border between morning and evening 


I was a child and grew like a greening tree and let the wind 
and distant cries and commotion of opposites / blow calmly 
through my branches, I was a boy and mocked fallen heroes, I 
‘was a youth pushing aside their clutching grips left and right, 
and so I did not anticipate the Powerful, Blind, and Immortal 
One, who wandered longingly after the sinking sun, who wanted 
to cleave the ocean down to its bottom so he could descend into 
the source of life. That which husries toward the rising is small, 
that which approaches the descent is great. Hence I was small, 
since I simply came from the depths of my descent. I had been 
where he yearned to be. He who descends is great, and it would 
be easy for him to smash me. A God who looks like the sun does not 
hhunt worms. But the worm aims at the heel of the Powerful One 
and will prepare him for the descent that he needs. His power is 
great and blind. He is marvelous to look at and frightening, But 
the serpent finds its spot. A little poison and the great one falls. 
The words of the one who rises have no sound and taste bitter, 
It is not a sweet poison, but one that is fatal for all Gods. 


Alas, he is my dearest, most beautiful friend, he who rushes across 
pursuing the sun and wanting to marry himself with the émmeasurable 
‘mother asthe sun does. How closely akin, indeed how completely one are the 
serpent and the God! The word which was our deliveer has become a deadly 
weapons, a serpent that secretly stabs. 


No longer do outer opposites stand in my way, but my own 
opposite comes toward me, and rises up hugely before me, and 
we block each other's way. The word of the serpent certainly 
defeats the danger, but my way remains barred, since I then had 
to fall from paralysis into blindness, just as the Powerful One fell 
into paralysis to escape his blindness. I cannot reach the blinding 
power of the sun, just as he, the Powerful One, cannot reach the 
ever-fruitful womb of darkness. I seem to be denied power, while 
he is denied rebirth, but I escape the blindness that comes with 
power and he escapes the nothingness that comes with death My 
hope for the fullness of the light shatters, just as his longing for 
boundless conquered life shatters. I had felled the strongest, and 
the God climbs down to mortality.

[OB 42] The noise ofthe days of the world falls silent, and the warming 
fire blazes inside. 

Sitving atthe fire, the shades of those gone before wail sofily and give news 
ofthe past. 

‘Come tothe soltary fire, you bind and lame ones and hear ofboth kinds 
of truth: the blind wil be lamed and the lamed wil be Blinded, yer the shared

The primordial fire that conquers every necessity shall burn again, since 
the night of the world is wide and cold, and the need is great. 

The well-proteced fire brings together those from: far away and those who 
«are cold, those who do not see one another and cannot reach one another, and 
it conquers suffering and shatters need. 

The words uttered at the fire are ambiguous and deep and show life the 
right way. 

The blind shall be lamed, so that he will not run into the abyss, and the 
lamed shall be Blind, so that he will not look at things beyond his reach with 
longing and contempt. 

Both may be aware of their dep helplessness so that they will respect the 
holy fire again, as well asthe shades sitting atthe hearth, and the words that 
encircle the flames. 


The ancients called the saving word the Logos, an expression 
of divine reason. So much unreason / was in man that he 
needed reason to be saved. If one waits long enough, one sees 
how the Gods all change into serpents and underworld dragons 
in the end. This is also the fate of the Logos: in the end it poisons 
us all, In time, we were all poisoned, but unknowingly we kept 
the One, the Powerful One, the eternal wanderer in us away 
from the poison. We spread poison and paralysis around us in 
that we want to educate all the world around us into reason 

Some have their reason in thinking, others in feeling. Both are 
servants of Logos, and in secret become worshipers of the serpent."

yourself bloody every day: you have crushed yourself, but not 
overcome yourself. Precisely through this you have helped the 
Powerful One, strengthened your paralysis, and promoted his 
blindness. He would like to see it in others, and inflict it on them, 
and would like to force the Logos on you and others, longingly and 
tyrannically with blind obstinacy and vacant stubborness. Give 
hhim a taste of Logos. He is afraid, and he already trembles from 
afar since he suspects that he has become outdated, and that a tiny 
droplet of the poison of Logos will paralyze him. But because he is 
your beautiful, much loved brother, you will act slavishly toward 
him and you would like to spare him as you have spared none of 
your fellow men. You spared no merry and no powerful means to 
strike your fellow men with the poisoned arrow: Paralyzed game is 
an unworthy prey. The powerful huntsman, who wrestles the bull 
to the ground and tears the lion to pieces and strikes the army of 
Tiamat, is your bow’s worthy target." 


If you live as he whom you are, He will come running against 
you impetuously, and you can hardly miss him. He will lay violent 
hands on you and force you into slavery if you do not remember 
your terrible weapon, which you have always used in his service

against yourself, You will be cunning, terrible, and cold if you 
make the beautiful and much loved fall, But you should not kill 
him, even if he suffers and writhes in unbearable agony. Bind the 
holy Sebastian to a tree and slowly and rationally shoot arrow 
after arrow into his twitching flesh.” When you do so, remind 
yourself that each arrow that strikes him spares one of your 
dwarfish and lame brothers, So you may shoot many arrows. But 
there is a misunderstanding that occurs all too frequently and is 
almost ineradicable: Men always want to destroy the beautiful and 
much loved outside of themselves, but never within themselves. 





He, the beautiful and most loved one, came to me from the East, 
from just that place which I was seeking to reach. Admiringly I 
saw his power and magnificence, and I recognized that he was 
striving for precisely what I had abandoned, namely my dark 
‘human milling crowd of abjection. I recognized the blindness and. 
tunknowingness of his striving which worked against my desire, 
and I opened his eyes and lamed his powerful limbs with a poisoned. 
stab, And he lay crying like a child, as that which he was, a child, a 
primordial grown child that required human Logos. So he lay before 
me, helpless, my blind God, who had become half-seeing and 
paralyzed. And compassion seized me, since it was plain to me 
that I should not let him die, he who approached me from the 
rising, from that place where he could be well, but which I could 
never reach, He whom I sought I now possessed. The East could 
give me nothing other than him, the sick and fallen one. 


You need to undertake only half of the way, he will undertake 
the other half. If you go beyond him, blindness will befall you. 
If he goes beyond you, paralysis will befall him. Therefore, and 
insofar as it is the manner of the Gods to go beyond mortals, they 
become paralyzed, and become as helpless as children. Divinity 
and humanity should remain preserved, if man should remain 
before the God, and the God remain before man, The high-blazing 
flame is the middle way, whose luminous course runs between the 
human and the divine 

The divine primordial power is blind, since its face has 
become human, The human is the face of the Godhead. If the 
God comes near you, then plead for your life to be spared, since 
the God is loving horror. The ancients said: itis terrible to fall 
into the hands of the living God." They spoke thus because they 
knew, since they were still close to the ancient forest, and they 
turned green like the trees in a childlike manner and ascended far 
away toward the East. / 

Consequently they fell into the hands of the living God. They 
learned to kneel and to lie with their faces down, to beg for pity, 
and they learned to live in servile fear and to be grateful. But he 
who saw him, the terrible beautiful one with his black velvet eyes 
and the long eyelashes, the eyes that do not see but merely gaze 
lovingly and fearfully, he has learned to cry out and whimper, 





SECOND DAY | 281 


so that he can at least reach the ear of the Godhead. Only your 
fearful cry can stop the God. And then you see that the God also 
trembles, since he stands confronting his face, his observing gaze 
in you, and he feels unknown power. The God is afraid of man. 


If my God is lamed, I must stand by him, since I cannot abandon 
the much-loved. I sense that he is my lot, my brother, who abided 
and grew in the light while I was in the darkness and fed myself 
with poison. It is good to know such things: ifwe are surrounded 
by night, our brother stands in the fullness of the light, doing his 
great deeds, tearing up the lion and killing the dragon. And he 
draws his bow against ever more distant goals, until he becomes 
aware of the sun wandering high up in the sky and wants to 
catch it. But when he has discovered his valuable prey, then your 
longing for the light also awakens, You discard the fetters and 
take yourself to the place of the rising light. And thus you rush 
toward each other. He believed he could simply capture the sun 
and encountered the worm of the shadows. You thought that in 
the East you could drink from the source of the light, and catch 
the horned giant, before whom you fall to your knees. His essence 
is blind excessive longing and tempestuous force. My essence is 
seeing limitation and the incapacity of cleverness. He possesses in 
abundance what I lack. Consequently I will also not let him go, 
the Bull God, who once wounded Jacob's hip and whom I have 
now lamed.”” I want to make his force my own, 

It is therefore prudent to keep alive the severely afflicted so 
that his force continues to support me, We miss nothing more 
than divine force. We say, “Yes, indeed, this is how it should or 
could be. This or that should be achieved.” We speak thus and 
stand thus, and look about us embarrassed, to see whether some- 
how something will occur. And should something happen, we 
look on and say: “Yes, indeed, we understand, it is this or that, 
or it is similar to this or that.” And thus we speak and stand 
and look around to see whether somewhere something might 
happen. Something always happens, but we do not happen, 
since our God is sick. We have seen him dead with the venomous 
gaze of the Basilisk on his face, and we have understood that he 
is dead. We must think of his healing And yet again I feel it 
quite clearly that my life would have broken in half had I failed to 
heal my God. Hence I abided with him in the long cold night

Izdubar, and I do not want him to wither away miserably. But 
where should help come from? No one will travel the hot-cold 
path, And I? I am afraid to return to that path, And in the East? 
Was there possibly help there? But what about the unknown 
dangers that loomed there? I do not want to go blind. What use 
would that be to Izdubar? I cannot carry this lamed one as a 
blind man either. Yes, if I were powerful like Izdubar, What use 
is science here? 

“Toward evening I went up to lzdubar and spoke to him: “Izdubar, 
my prince, listen! I will not let you decline. The second evening is 
falling, We have no food and we are bound to die if I cannot find 
help. We cannot expect any help from the West, but help is possible 
from the East. Did you meet anyone on your way whom we could 
call on for help?” 

lz: “Let it be, may death come when it will” 

I: “My heart bleeds at the thought of leaving you here without 
having done the upmost to help you.” 

Iz:"What help is your magical power to you? Ifyou were strong, 
as Iam, you could carry me. But your poison can only destroy and 
not help.” 

I: “If we were in my land, swift wagons could bring us help” 

Iz: “If we were in my land, your poisoned barb would not have 
reached me.” 

1: “Tell me, do you know of no help from the side of the East?” 

lz: “The way there is long and lonely, and when you reach the 
plains after crossing the mountains, you will meet the powerful 
sun which will blind you” 

1; “But what if I wandered by night and if I sheltered from the 
sun during the day?” 

12: "In the night all the serpents and dragons crawl out of their 
holes and you, unarmed, will inevitably fall victim to them. Let it 
be! How would this help? My legs have withered and are numb. 
I prefer not to bring home the booty of this journey” 

I: “Should I not risk everything?” 

Iz: “Useless! Nothing is gained if you die.” 

I: “Let me think it over a bit, perhaps a saving thought will yet 
come to me.” 

L withdraw and sit down on a rock high above on the ridge of 
the mountain. And this speech began in me: Great Izdubas, you 
are in a hopeless position—and I no less." What can be done? It 
is not always necessary to act; sometimes thinking is better. I am 
basically convinced that Izdubar is hardly real in the ordinary sense, 
but is a fantasy. It would help if the situation were considered 
from another angle. considered... considered... itis remarkable 
that even here thoughts echo; one must be quite alone. But this 
will hardly last. He will of course not accept that he is a fantasy, 
but instead claim that he is completely real and that he can only 
be helped in a real way: nevertheless, it would be worth trying this 
means once. I will appeal to him: 

I: “My prince, Powerful One, listen: a thought came to me 
that might save us. I think that you are not at all real, but only 
a fantasy.” 

Tz: “I am terrified by this thought. It is murderous, Do you 
even mean to declare me unreal /—now that you have lamed 
me so pitifully? 


113 The Draft continues: “thus spoke another voice in me, like an echo” (p. 309) 


I: “Perhaps I have not made myself clear enough, and have 
spoken too much in the language of the Western lands. I do not 
‘mean to say that you are not real at all, of course, but only as real 
as a fantasy. If you could accept this, much would be gained.” 

lz: “What would be gained by this? You are a tormenting devil” 

1: “Pitiful one, I will not torment you. The hand of the doctor 
does not seek to torment even if it causes grief Can you really not 
accept that you are a fantasy?” 

lu: “Woe betide me! In what magic do you want to entangle 
me? Should it help me if I take myself for a fantasy?” 

1: "You know that the name one bears means a lot. You also 
know that one often gives the sick new names to heal them, for 
with the new name, they come by a new essence. Your name is 
your essence 

a: “You are right, our priests also say this.” 

I: "So are you prepared to admit that you are a fantasy?” 

le: “Ifit helps—yes.” 

The inner voice now spoke to me as follows: while admittedly 
he is a fantasy now, the situation remains extremely complex. 
A fantasy cannot be simply negated and treated with resignation 
either. It calls for action, Anyway, he is a fantasy—and thus 
considerably more volatile—I think I can see a way forward: I can 
take him on my back for now. I went to Tzdubar and said to him: 

“A way has been found. You have become light, lighter than 
a feather. Now I can carry you.” I put my arms round him and 
lift him up from the ground; he is lighter than ais, and I struggle to 
keep my feet on the ground since my load lifts me up into the air. 

Iz: “That was a masterstroke. Where are you carrying me?” 

I: “I am going to carry you down into the Western land. My 
comrades will happily accommodate such a large fantasy, Once 
we have crossed the mountains and have reached the houses of 
hospitable men, I can calmly go about finding a means to restore 
you completely again.” 

Carrying him on my back, I climb down the small rock path 
swith great care, more in danger of being whirled aloft by the wind 
than of losing balance because of my load and plunging down the 
mountainside, I hang on to my all too lightweight load. finally we 
reach the bottom of the valley and the way of the hot and cold 
pain, But this time I am blown by a whistling East wind down 
through the narrow rocks and across the fields toward inhabited 
places, making no contact with the painful way. Spurred on, I 
hasten through beautiful lands. I see wo people ahead of me: 
Ammonius and the Red One, When we are right behind them, 
they turn round and run off into the fields with horrified cries. I 
must have proved a strange sight indeed, 

Iz; “Who are these misshapen ones? Are these your comrades?” 

“These are not men, they are so-called relics of the past 
which one still often encounters in the Western lands, They used 
to be very important. They're now used mostly as shepherds.” 

Tz: “What a wondrous country! But look, isn’t that a town? 
‘Don't you want to go there?” 

I: “No, God forbid, I don’t want a crowd to gather, since the 
enlightened live there. Can't you smell them? They're actually 
dangerous, since they cook the strongest poisons from which even 
I must protect myself. The people there are totally paralyzed,

wrapped in a brown poisonous vapor and can only move with 
artificial means, / But you need not worry. Night has almost 
fallen and no one will see us. Moreover, no one would admit to 
hhaving seen me. I know an out of the way house here. I have close 
friends there who will take us in for the night.” 

Izdubar and I come to a quiet dark garden and a secluded 
house. I hide Izdubar under the drooping branches of a tree, go 
up to the door of the house, and knock I ponder the door: itis 
much too small. I will never be able to get Izdubar through it. 
‘Yet—a fantasy takes up no space! Why did this excellent thought 
not occur to me earlier? I return to the garden and with no 
difficulty squeeze Izdubar into the size of an egg and put him in 
my pocket. Then I walk into the welcoming house where Izdubar 
should find healing 


[J[HI 48] Thus my God found salvation. He was saved 
precisely by what one would actually consider fatal, namely by 
declaring him a figment of the imagination, How often has it 
been assumed that the Gods have been brought to their end in 
this way" This was obviously a serious mistake, since this was 
precisely what saved the God. He did not pass away, but became 
a living fantasy, whose workings I could feel on my own body: my 
inherent heaviness faded and the hot and cold way of pain no 
longer burned and froze my soles. The weight no longer kept me 
pressed to the ground, but instead the wind carried me lightly 
like a feather, while I carried the giant."* 

One used to believe that one could murder a God. But the 
God was saved, he forged a new axe in the fire, and plunged again 
into the flood of light of the East to resume his ancient cycle."” 
But we clever men crept around lamed and poisoned, and did not 
even know that we lacked something. But I loved my God, and 
took him to the house of men, since I was convinced that he also 
really lived as a fantasy, and should therefore not be left behind, 
wounded and sick. And hence I experienced the miracle of my 
body losing its heaviness when I burdened myself with the God. 

St. Christopher, the giant, bore his burden with difficulty, 
despite the fact that he bore only the Christ child,"* But I was 
as small as a child and bore a giant, and yet my burden lifted 
me up. The Christ child became an easy burden for the giant 
Christopher, since Christ himself said, “My yoke is sweet, and my 
burden is light» We should not bear Christ as he is unbearable, 
bur we should be Christs, for then our yoke is sweet and our 
burden easy. This tangible and apparent world is one reality, but 
fantasy is the other reality. So long as we leave the God outside us 
apparent and tangible, he is unbearable and hopeless. But if we 
turn the God into fantasy, he isin us and is easy to bear. The God 
outside us increases the weight of everything heavy, while the 
God within us lightens everything heavy. Hence all Christophers 
have stooped backs and short breath, since the world is heavy. 


SECOND DAY | 283, 


[HI 48/2] Many have wanted to get help for their sick God 
and were then devoured by the serpents and dragons lurking on 
the way to the land of the sun. They perished in the overbright 
day and have become dark men, since their eyes have been 
blinded. Now they go around like shadows and speak of the light 
but see little, Bur their God is in everything that they do not see 
He is in the dark Western lands and he sharpens seeing eyes and 
he assists those cooking the poison and he guides serpents to 
the heels of the blind perpetrators. Therefore, if you are clever, 
take the God with you, then you know where he is. If you do 
not have him with you in the Western lands, he will come 
running to you at night with clanking armor and a crushing 
battle axe.” If you do not have him with you in the land of the 
dawn, then you will step unawares on the divine worm who 
awaits your unsuspecting heel. / 


[HI 49] You gain everything from the God whom you bear, 
but not his weapon, since he crushed it. He who conquers needs 
weapons. But what else do you want to conquer? You cannot 
conquer more than the earth. And what is the earth? It is round 
all over and hangs like a drop in the cosmos. You will not reach 
the sun, and your power will not even extend to the barren moon; 
you will conquer neither the sea, nor the snow on the poles, nor 
the sands of the desert, but only a few spots on the green earth. 
You will not conquer anything for any length of time. Your power 
will turn into dust tomorrow, for above all—at the very least— 
you must conquer death. So do not be a fool, throw down your 
weapon. God himself smashed his weapon. Armor is enough 
to protect you from fools who still suffer from the need to 
conquer. God’s armor will make you invulnerable and invisible 
to the worst fools. 


Take your God with you. Bear him down to your dark land 
where people live who rub their eyes each morning and yet always 
see only the same thing and never anything else. Bring your God 
down to the haze pregnant with poison, but not like those blinded 
cones who try to illuminate the darkness with lanterns which it does 
not comprehend. Instead, secretly carry your God to a hospitable 
roof. The huts of men are small and they cannot welcome the 
God despite their hospitality and willingness. Hence do not wait 
until cawly bungling hands of men hack your God to pieces, but 
embrace him again, lovingly, until he has taken on the form of his 
first beginning. Let no human eye see. the much loved, terribly 
splendid one in the state of his illness and lack of power. Consider 
that your fellow men are animals without knowing it, So long as 
they go to pasture, or lie in the sun, or suckle their young, or mate 
with each other, they are beautiful and harmless creatures of dark 
Mother Earth. But if the God appears, they begin to rave, since 
the nearness of God makes people rave. They tremble with fear

/ [HI 62] However, I am not ready, since I have still not accepted 
that which chokes my heart. That fearful thing is the enclosing of 
the God in the egg. I am happy that the great endeavor has been 
successful, but my fear made me forget the hazards involved. I 
love and admire the powerful. No one is greater than he with the 
bulls horns, and yet I lamed, carried, and made him smaller with 
case, I almost slumped to the ground with fear when I saw him, 
and now I rescue him with a cupped hand, These are the powers 
that make you afraid and conquer you; these have been your Gods 
and your rulers since time immemorial: yet you can put them in 
your pocket. What is blasphemy compared to this? I would like to be 
able to blaspheme against the God: That way I would atleast have 
God whom I could insult, but it is not worth blaspheming against 
an egg that one carries in one’s pocket. That is a God against 
‘whom one cannot even blaspheme 

I hated this pitifulness of the God. My own unworthiness 
is already enough, Ie cannot bear my encumbering it with the 
pitifulness of the God. Nothing stands firm: you touch yourself 
and you turn to dust, You touch the Ged and he hides terrified in 
the egg, You force the gates of Hell: the sound of cackling masks 
and the music of fools approaches you. You storm Heaven: stage 
scenery totters and the prompter in the box falls into a swoon. You 
notice: you are not true, itis not true above, it is not true below, 
lefe and right are deceptions. Wherever you grasp is air, air, air.

That is the end of the story of the Gods. Nothing remains of 
the Gods other than an egg. And I possess this egg. Perhaps I 
can eradicate this last one and with this finally exterminate the 
race of Gods, Now that I know that the Gods have yielded to my 
power—what are the Gods to me now? Old and overripe, they 
have fallen and been buried in an egg.

The Opening of the Egg. 

Cap. xi 

[HI 65] On the evening of the third day, 1 el down on the rug and 
carefully open the egg. Something resembling smoke rises up from it 
and suddenly T2dubar is standing before me, enormous, transformed, and 
complete. His linbs are whole and I find no trace of damage on them. It as 
{fhe had awoken from a deep seep. He says: 


“Where am I> How narrow itis ere, how dark, how cool—am T 
fn the grave? Where was I? It semed to meas if had been ouside tn the

Streams of ire broke from my radiating body —

Fall oflghs, fl of longing, fll of eternity — 

1 was ancient and perpetually renewing myself— 

Falling from the heights othe depts, 
and whirled glowing from the depth to the heights — 
hovering around myself amidst glowing clouds — 

45 raining embers beating down like the foam ofthe surf, engulfing 
1 myself in sifing heat — 

Embracing and rejecting myself in a boundless game— 

‘Where was 1? Tas compleely sun.” 


65/66 


1: “Oh Izdubar! Divine one! How wonderful! You are healed!” 


“Heald? Was I ever sick? Who speaks of sickness? was sun, compleely 
sun. I am the sun.” 


‘An inexpressible light breaks from his body, a light that my 
eyes cannot grasp. I must cover my face and cast my gaze to 
the ground. 

I: "You are the sun, the eternal light—most powerful one, 
forgive me for carrying you.” 

Everything is quiet and dark. I look around me: the empty 
egg shell is lying on the rug. I feel myself, the floor, the walls: 
everything is as usual, utterly plain and utterly real. I would like 
to say that everything around me has turned to gold. But it is not 
true—everything is as it always has been. Here reigned eternal 
light, immeasurable and overpowering.” 


[2] [HI 66] Ir happened that I opened the egg and that the God 
left the egg. He was healed and his figure shone transformed, 
and I knelt like a child and could not grasp the miracle. He who 
had been pressed into the core of the beginning rose up, and no 
trace of illness could be found on him. And when I thought that 
Thad caught the mighty one and held him in my cupped hands, 
he was the sun itself,

I wandered toward the East where the sun rises, I probably 
wanted to rise, too, as if I were the sun, I wanted to embrace 
the sun and rise with it into daybreak. But it came toward me 
and stood in my way: It told me that I had no chance of reaching 
the beginning. But I lamed the one who wanted to rush down 
in order to set with the sun in the womb of the night; he was 
deprived of all hope of reaching the blessed Western lands 

But behold! I caught the sun without realizing it and carried 
ic in my hand, He who wanted to go down with the sun found 
me through his downgoing, I became his nocturnal mother who 
incubated the egg of the beginning, And he rose up, renewed, 
reborn to greater splendor. 

‘While he rises, however, I go down. When I conquered the 
God, his force streamed into me, But when the God rested in 
the egg and awaited his beginning, my force went into him. And 
when he rose up radiantly, I lay on my face. He took my life with 
him, All my force was now in him, My soul swam like a fish in his 
sea of fire. But I lay in the frightful cool of the shadows of the 
earth and sank down deeper and deeper to the lowest darkness. 
All light had left me. The God rose in the Eastern lands and I fell 
into the horror of the underworld. I lay there like a child-bearer 
cruelly mauled and bleeding her life into the child, uniting life 
and death in a dying glance, the day’s mother, the night's prey. My 
God had torn me apart terribly, he had drunk the juice of my life, 
he had drunk my highest power into him and became marvelous and 
strong like the sun, an unblemished God who bore no stigma or 
flaw. He had taken my wings from me, he had robbed me of the 
swelling force of my muscles, and the power of my will disappeared 
with him. He left me powerless and groaning 

/ 1 did not know what was happening to me, since simply 
everything powerful, beautiful, blissful, and superhuman had 
leaked from my maternal womb; none of the radiant gold remained. 
Cruelly and unthinkably the sunbird spread its wings and flew up 
into infinite space. I was left with the broken shells and the 
miserable casing of his beginning; the emptiness of the depths 
opened beneath me. 

‘Woe betide the mother who gives birth to a God! If she gives 
birth to a wounded and pain-stricken God, a sword will pierce 
her soul, But if she gives birth to an unblemished God, then Hell will 
open to her, from which monstrous serpents will rise convulsively 
to suffocate the mother with miasma. Birth is difficult, but a 
thousand times more difficult is the hellish afterbirth.”* All the 
dragons and monstrous sexpents of eternal emptiness follow 
behind the divine son. 

‘What remains of human nature when the God has become 
mature and has seized all power? Everything incompetent, every- 
thing powerless, everything eternally vulgar, everything adverse 
and unfavorable, everything reluctant, diminishing, exterminating, 
everything absurd, everything that the unfathomable night of 
matter encloses in itself, that is the afterbirth of the God and his 
hellish and dreadfully deformed brother. 

The God suffers when man does not accept his darkness 
Consequently men must have a suffering God, so long as they 
suffer from evil. To suffer from evil means: you still love evil and 
yet love it no longer. You still hope to gain something, but you 
do not want to look closely for fear that you might discover that 
you still love evil. The God suffers because you continue to suffer 
from loving evil. You do not suffer from evil because you recognize 
it, but because it affords you secret pleasure, and because you 
believe it promises the pleasure of an unknown opportunity 


138 In the next chapter, Jung finds himself in Hell 





‘THE OPENING OF THE EGG | 287 


So long as your God suffers, you have sympathy with him and 
‘with yourself, You thus spare your Hell and prolong his suffering 
Ifyou want to make him well without engaging in secret sympathy 
‘with yourself, evil puts a spoke in your wheel—the evil whose form 
you generally recognize, but whose hellish strength in yourself 
you do not know. Your unknowing stems from the previous 
harmlessness of your life, from the peaceful passage of time, and 
from the absence of the God. But if the God draws near, your 
essence starts to seethe and the black mud of the depths whitls up. 

Man stands between emptiness and fullness. If his strength 
combines with fullness, it becomes fully formative. There is always 
something good about such formation, If his strength combines 
with emptiness, it has a dissolving and destructive effect, since 
emptiness can never be formed, but only strives to satisfy itself at 
the cost of fullness. Combined thus human force turns empti- 
ness into evil. If your force shapes fullness, it does so because of 
its association with fullness. But to ensure that your formation 
continues to exist, it must remain tied to your strength, Through 
constant shaping, you gradually lose your force, since ultimately 
all force is associated with the shapeliness that has been given 
form, Ultimately, where you mistakenly imagine that you are 
rich, you have actually become poor, and you stand amidst your 
forms like a beggar. That is when the blinded man is seized by 
an increasing desire to give shape to things, since he believes 
that manifold increased formation will satisfy his desire. 
Because he has spent his force, he becomes desirous; he begins 
to compel others into his service and takes their force to pursue 
his own designs. 

In this moment, you need evil. When you notice that your 
strength is coming to an end and desire sets in, you must withdraw 
it from what has been formed into your emptiness; through this 
association with the emptiness you will succeed in dissolving the 
formation in you. You will thus regain your freedom, in that you 
have saved your strength from oppressive association with the 
object. So long as you persist with the standpoint of the good, 
you cannot dissolve your formation, precisely because it is what 
is good. You cannot dissolve good with good. You can dissolve 
good only with evil. For your good also leads ultimately to death 
through its progressive binding of your force by progressively 
binding your force, You are entirely unable to live without evil 

Your shaping first produces an image of your formation within 
you, This image remains in you and / it is the first and 
unmediated expression of your shaping, It then produces precisely 
through this image an outer one, which can exist without you 
and outlive you. Your strength is not directly linked to your 
outer formation, but only through the image that remains in You. 
‘When you set about dissolving your formation with evil, you do 
not destroy the outer shape, or else you would be destroying your 
own work. But what you do destroy is the image that you have 
formed in yourself. For it is this image that clings to your force. 
You will need evil to dissolve your formation, and to free yourself 
from the power of what has been, to the same extent which this 
image fetters your strength. 

Hence their formation causes many good persons to bleed to 
death, because they cannot attend to evil in the same measure. 
The better one is and the more attached one is to one's formation, 
the more one will lose one’s force. But what happens when the 
good person has lost their force completely to their formation? 
Not only will they seek to force others into the service of their 
formation with unconscious cunning and power, but they will 


67/68 


68/69 


288 | LIBER SECUNDUS 68/75 


also become bad in their goodness without knowing it, since their 
longing for satisfaction and strengthening will make them more 
and more selfish, But because of this the good ones will ultimately 
destroy their own work, and all those whom they forced into the 
service of their own work will become their enemies, because they 
will have alienated them. But you will also secretly begin to hate 
whoever alienates you from yourself against your own wishes, 
even if this were in the best interest of things. Unfortunately, the 
good person who has bound his strength will all too easily find 
slaves for his service, since there are more than plenty who yearn 
for nothing more strongly than to be alienated from themselves 
under a good pretext. 

‘You suffer from evil because you love it secretly and are unaware 
of your love. You wish to escape your predicament, and you begin 
to hate evil. And once more you are bound to evil through your 
hate, since whether you love or hate it, it makes no difference: you 
are bound to evil. Evil is to be accepted, What we want remains 
in our hands. What we do not want, and yet is stronger than us, 
sweeps us away and we cannot stop it without damaging ourselves, 
for our force remains in evil. Thus we probably have to accept 
our evil without love and hate, recognizing that it exists and must 
have its share in life, In doing so, we can deprive it of the power 
it has to overwhelm us. 





When we have succeeded in making a God, and if through 
this creation our whole force has entered into this design, we are 
filled with an overwhelming desire to rise with the divine sun and 
to become a part of its magnificence. But we forget that we are 
then no more than hollow forms, since giving form to God has 
sapped us completely. We are not only poor but have become 
sluggish matter throughout, which would never be entitled to 
share in divinity. 

Like a terrible suffering or an inescapable devilish persecution, 
the misery and neediness of our matter creeps up on us. The 
powerless matter begins to suckle and would like to swallow its 
shape back into itself again. But since we are always enamored of 
our own design, we believe that the God calls us to him, and we 
make desperate attempts to follow the God into the higher realm, 
or we turn preachingly and demandingly to our fellow men to at 
any rate force others into following the God. Unfortunately there 
are men who allow themselves to be persuaded into doing this, to 
their and our detriment. 

‘Much undoing resides in this urge: since who could suspect that 
he who has made the God is himself condemned to Hell? But this 
is the way it is, because the matter that is stripped of the divine 
radiance of force is empty and dark. Ifthe God alights from matter, 
wwe feel the emptiness of matter as one part of endless empty space. 

Through haste and increased willing and action we want to 
escape from emptiness and also from evil. But the right way is 
that we accept emptiness, destroy the image of the form within 
us, negate the God, and descend into the abyss and awfulness of 
matter. The God as our work stands outside us and no longer 
needs our help. He is created and remains left to his own devices. 
‘A created work that perishes again immediately once we turn 
away from it is not worth anything, even if it / were a God. 
139 In “Dream” Jung wrote on February 1,917; Finished copying the openi 


(5). This refers to completing, 
140 The blue and yellow ciecies are silt to image 60. 





But where is the God after his creation and after his separation 
from me? If you build a house, you see it standing in the outer 
world. When you have created a God whom you cannot see with 
your own eyes, then he is in the spiritual world that is no less 
valuable than the outer physical world. He is there and does 
everything for you and others that you would expect from a God. 

‘Thus your soul is your own self in the spiritual world. As the 
abode of the spirits, however, the spiritual world is also an outer 
world, Just as you are also not alone in the visible world, but are 
surrounded by objects that belong to you and obey only you, you 
also have thoughts that belong to you and obey only you. But just 
as you are surrounded in the visible world by things and beings 
that neither belong to you nor obey you, you are also surrounded 
in the spiritual world by thoughts and beings of thought that 
neither obey you nor belong to you. Just as you engender or bear 
your physical children, and just as they grow up and separate 
themselves from you to live their own fate, you also produce or 
give birth to beings of thought which separate themselves from 
youand live their own lives. Just as we leave our children when we 
grow old and give our body back to the earth, I separate myself 
from my God, the sun, and sink into the emptiness of matter and 
obliterate the image of my child in me. This happens in that I 
accept the nature of matter and allow the force of my form to flow 
into emptiness, Just as I gave birth anew to the sick God through 
my engendering force, I henceforth animate the emptiness of 
matter from which the formation of evil grows. 


Nature is playful and terrible. Some sce the playful side and dally with it 
and let it sparkle, Others see the horror and cover their heads and are more 
dead than alive. The way doesnot lead between both, but embraces both, 1¢

Cap. xii 


[HI 73] On the second night** after the creation of my God, a 
vision made known to me that I had reached the underworld, 

I find myself in a gloomy vault, whose floor consists of damp 
stone slabs, In the middle there is a column from which ropes and 
axes hang At the foot of the column there lies an awful serpentlike 
tangle of human bodies. At first I catch sight of the figure of a 
young maiden with wonderful red-gold hair—a man of devilish 
appearance is lying half under her—his head is bent backward—a 
thin streak of blood runs down his forchead—two similar daimons 
have thrown themselves over the maiden's feet and body. Their 
faces bear an inhuman expression—the living evil—their muscles 
are taut and hard, and their bodies sleek like serpents. They lie 
motionless, The maiden holds her hand over one eye of the man 
lying beneath her, who is the most powerful of the three—her hand 
firmly clasps a small silver fishing rod that she has driven into the 
eye of the devil. 

I break out in a profuse cold sweat. They wanted to torture 
the maiden to death, but she defended herself with the force of

the most extreme despair, and succeeded in piercing the eye of 
the evil one with the little hook. IFhe moves, she will tear out his 
eye with a final jerk. The horror paralyzes me: what will happen? 
A voice speaks: 

“The evil one cannot make a sacrifice, he cannot sacrifice his ey, victory 
{s with the one who can sarific.”** 


[2] The vision vanished. I saw that my soul had fallen into the 
power of abysmal evil. The power of evil is unquestionable, and 
wwe rightfully fear it. Here no prayers, no pious words, no magical 
sayings help. Once raw power comes after you, there is no help. 
Once evil seizes you without pity, no father, no mother, no right, 
no wall and tower, no armor and protective power come to your 
aid. You fall powerless and forlorn into the hand of the superior 
power of evil In this battle you are all alone. Because I wanted to 
give birth to my God, I also wanted evil, He who wants to create 
an eternal fullness will also create eternal emptiness. You cannot 
undertake one without the other. But if you want to escape evil, 
you will create no God, everything that you do is tepid and gray. 
I wanted my God for the sake of grace and disgrace. Hence I also 
want my evil, If my God were not overpowering, neither would 
be my evil. But I want my God to be powerful and beyond all 
measure happy and lustrous. Only in this way do I love my God. 
‘And the luster of his beauty will also have me taste the very 
bottom of Hell. 

My God rose in the Eastern sky, brighter than the heavenly 
host, and brought about a new day for all the peoples. This is why 
L want to go to Hell. Would a mother not want to give up her life 
for her child? How much easier would it be to give up my life if 
only my God could overcome the torment of the last hour of the 
night and victoriously break through the red mist of the morning? 
1 do not doubt: I also want evil for the sake of my God. I enter 
the unequal battle, since it is always unequal and without doubt 
a lost cause. How terrible and despairing would this battle be 
otherwise? But precisely this is how it should and will be. 


/ Nothing is more valuable to the evil one than his eye, since 
only through his eye can emptiness seize gleaming fullness 
Because the emptiness lacks fullness, it craves fullness and its 
shining power. And it drinks it in by means of its eye, which is 
able to grasp the beauty and unsullied radiance of fullness. The 
emptiness is poor, and if it lacked its eye it would be hopeless. 
It sees the most beautiful and wants to devour it in order to 
spoil it. The devil knows what is beautiful, and hence he is 
the shadow of beauty and follows it everywhere, awaiting the 
moment when the beautiful, writhing great with child, seeks to 
give life to the God 

If your beauty grows, the dreadful worm will also creep up 
you, waiting for its prey. Nothing is sacred to him except his eye, 
‘with which he sees the most beautiful. He will never give up his 
eye. He is invulnerable, but nothing protects his eye; itis delicate 
and clear, adept at drinking in the eternal light. It wants you, the 
bright red light of your life. 


HELL | 289 


1 recognize the fearful devilishness of human nature. I cover 
my eyes before it. I put out my hand to fend it off, anyone wants 
to approach me for fear that my shadow could fall on him, or his 
shadow could fall on me, since I also see the devilish in him, who 
is the harmless companion of his shadow. 

No one touches me, death and crime lie in wait for you and 
‘me. You smile innocently, my friend? Don’t you see that a gentle 
flickering of your eye betrays the frightfulness whose unsuspect- 
ing messenger you are? Your bloodthirsty tiger growls softly, your 
poisonous serpent hisses secretly, while you, conscious only of 
your goodness, offer your human hand to me in greeting, I know 
your shadow and mine, that follows and comes with us, and only 
waits for the hour of twilight when he will strangle you and me 
with all the daimons of the night. 


What abyss of blood-dripping history separates you from me! 
1 grasped your hand and looked at you. I lay my head in your lap 
and felt the living warmth of your body on mine as if it were my 
own body—and suddenly I felt a smooth cord around my neck, 
which choked me mercilessly, and a cruel hammer blow struck a 
nail into my temple. I was dragged by my feet along the pavement, 
and wild hounds gnawed my body in the lonely night. 


No one should be astonished that men are so far removed 
from one another that they cannot understand one another, 
that they wage war and kill one another, One should be much more 
surprised that men believe they are close, understand one another 
and love one another. ‘Two things are yet to be discovered. The 
first is the infinite gulf that separates us from one another. The 
second is the bridge that could connect us. Have you considered 
how much unsuspected animality human company makes possible? 


“When my soul fell into the hands of evil, it was defenseless 
except for the weak fishing rod which it could use, again with its 
power, to pull the fish from the sea of emptiness. The eye of the 
evil one sucked in all the force of my soul; only its will remained, 
which is just that small fish hook. I wanted evil, since I realized 
that I was not able to elude it. And because I wanted evil, my soul 
held the precious hook in its hand, that was supposed to strike the 
vulnerable place of the evil one. He who does not want evil will 
have no chance to save his soul from Hell, So long as he remains 
in the light of the upper world, he will become a shadow of himself. 
But his soul will languish in the dungeons of the daimons. This 
will act as a counterbalance that will forever constrain him. The 
higher circles of the inner world will remain unattainable for 
him. He remains where he was; indeed, he falls back. You know 
these people, and you know how extravagantly nature strews / 
human life and force on barren deserts. You should not lament 
this, otherwise you will become a prophet, and will seek to 
redeem what cannot be redeemed. Do you not know that nature 
also dungs its fields with men? Take in the seeker, but do not go 
out seeking those who err. What do you know about their error? 
Perhaps it is sacred. You should not disturb the sacred. Do not

“There is nothing the emptiness can sacrifice, since it always 
suffers lack. Only fullness can sacrifice, since it has fullness. 
Emptiness cannot sacrifice its hunger for fullness, since it cannot 
deny its own essence, Therefore we also need evil, But I can 
sacrifice my will to evil, because I previously received fullness, All 
strength flows back to me again, since the evil one has destroyed 
the image I had of the formation of the God. But the image of 
the God's formation in me was not yet destroyed. I dread this 
destruction, since it is terrible, an unprecedented desecration of 
temples. Everything in me strives against this abysmal abomination. 
For I still did not know what it means to give birth to a God.

The Sacrificial Murder.” 


Cap. xi. 


[HI 76] But this was the vision that I did not want to see, the 
horror that I did not want to live: A sickening feeling of nausea 
sneaks up on me, and abominable, perfidious serpents wind their 
way slowly and cracklingly through parched undergrowth; they 
hang down lazily and disgustingly lethargic from the branches, 
looped in dreadful knots. I am reluctant to enter this dreary and 
unsightly valley, where the bushes stand in arid stony defiles, The 
valley looks so normal, its air smells of crime, of foul, cowardly 
deeds. I am seized by disgust and horror. I walk hesitantly over 
the boulders, avoiding every dark place for fear of treading on a 
serpent. The sun shines weakly out of a gray and distant sky, and 
all the leaves are shriveled. A marionette with a broken head lies 
before me amidst the stones—a few steps further, a small apron— 
and then behind the bush, the body of a small girl—covered with 
terrible wounds—smeared with blood, One foot is clad with a 
stocking and shoe, the other is naked and gorily crushed—the 
head—where is the head? The head is a mash of blood with hair 
and whitish pieces of bone, surrounded by stones smeared with 
brain and blood. My gaze is captivated by this awful sight—a 
shrouded figure, like that of a woman, is standing calmly next to 
the child; her face is covered by an impenetrable veil. She asks me: 

S: "What then do you say?” 

I: “What should I say? This is beyond words.” 

S:"Do you understand this?” 

I: “I refuse to understand such things. I can’t speak about 
them without becoming enraged.” 


146 The Heandrten Draft has instead “Eighth Adventure” (9.793) 


S: “Why become enraged? You might as well rage every day of 
yout life, for these and similar things occur every day.” 

1: “But most of the time we don't see them.” 

S:“So knowing that they happen is not enough to enrage you?” 

I: “If I merely have knowledge of something, its easier and 
simpler. The horror is less real if all I have is knowledge.” 

S: “Step nearer and you will see that the body of the child has 
been cut open; take out the liver.” 

L:“Lwill not touch this corpse, If someone witnessed this, they 
would think that I'm the murderer.” 

S: “You are cowardly; take out the liver.” 

1: "Why should I do this? This is absurd.” 

S:*L want you to remove the liver. You must do it.” 

1: “Who are you to give me such an order?” 

S: "I am the soul of this child, You must do this for my sake.” 

I“ don’t understand, but I'll believe you and do this horrific 
and absurd deed.” / 

T reach into the child's visceral cavity—it is still warm—the 
liver is still firmly attached—I take my knife and cut it free of 
the ligaments. Then I take it out and hold it with bloody hands 
toward the figure. 

S:"T thank you.” 

I: "What should I do?” 

S: “You know what the liver means, and you ought to perform 
the healing act with it.” 

1: “What is to be done?” 

S: “Take a piece of the liver, in place of the whole, and eat i 

1: “What are you demanding? This is absolute madness. This is 
desecration, necrophilia. You make me a guilty party to this most 
hideous of all crimes.” 

S: *You have devised the most horrible torment for the 
murderer, which could atone for his act. There is only one 
atonement: abase yourself and eat.” 

I: “I cannot—I refuse—I cannot participate in this 
horrible guilt.” 

S:*You share in this guilt.” 

1: “T? Share in this guile?” 

S: "You are a man, and a man has committed this deed.” 

1: "Yes, Lama man—I curse whoever did this for being a man, 
and I curse myself for being a man,” 

S: "So, take part in his act, abase yourself and eat. I need 
atonement.” 

1: "So shall it be for your sake, as you are the soul of this child.” 





I kneel down on the stone, cut off a piece of the liver and 
put it in my mouth. My gorge rises—tears burst from my eyes— 
cold sweat covers my brow—a dull sweet taste of blood—I 
swallow with desperate efforts—it is impossible—once again 
and once again—I almost faint—it is done, The horror has 
been accomplished."* 

S:"I thank you” 

She throws her veil back—a beautiful maiden with ginger hai, 

S: "Do you recognize me?” 

I: “How strangely familiar you are! Who are you?” 

S:“Tam your soul."

[2] The sacrifice has been accomplished: the divine child, the 
image of the God's formation, is slain, and T have eaten fom 
the sacrificial flesh."® The child, that is, the image of the God's 
formation, not only bore my human craving, but also enclosed 
all the primordial and elemental powers that the sons of the 
sun possess as an inalienable inheritance, The God needs all 
this for his gen 
away into unending space, we need the gold of the sun. We must 
regenerate ourselves, But as the creation of a God is a creative 
act of highest love, the restoration of our human life signifies an 
act of the Below. This is a great and dark mystery. Man cannot 
accomplish this act solely by himself, but is assisted by evil, which 
does it instead of man, But man must recognize his complicity in 
the act of evil. He must bear witness to this recognition by eating 
from the bloody sacrificial flesh. Through this act he testifies that 
he is a man, that he recognizes good as well as evil, and that he 
destroys the image of the God's formation through withdraw- 
ing his life force, with which he also dissociates himself from the 
God. This occurs for the salvation of the soul, which is the true 
mother of the divine child. / 

When it bore and gave birth to the God, my soul was of human 
nature throughout; it possessed the primordial powers since time 
immemorial, but only in a dormant condition, They flowed into 
forming the God without my help. But through the sacrificial 
murder, I redeemed the primordial powers and added them to 
my soul. Since they became part of a living pattern, they are no 
longer dormant, but awake and active and irradiate my soul 
with their divine working. Through this it receives a divine attri- 
bute. Hence the eating of the sacrificial flesh aided its healing. 
The ancients have also indicated this to us, in that they taught us 
to drink the blood and eat the flesh of the savior. The ancients 
believed that this brought healing to the soul"

proud of your shallow coastlines and broad country roads. But 
the floodgates will be opened, there are inexorable things, from 
which only God can save you. 


The primordial force is the radiance of the sun, which the 
sons of the sun have carried in themselves for aeons and pass on 
to their children. But if the soul dips into radiance, she becomes 
as remorseless as the God himself, since the life of the divine 
child, which you have eaten, will feel like glowing coals in you. 
Ie will burn inside you like a terrible, inextinguishable fire, But 
despite all the torment, you cannot let it be, since it will not let 
you be. From this you will understand that your God is alive and 
that your soul has begun wandering on remorseless paths. You 
feel that the fire of the sun has erupted in you. Something new 
has been added to you, a holy affliction. 

Sometimes you no longer recognize yourself, You want to 
overcome it, but it overcomes you. You want to set limits, 
bur it compels you to keep going. You want to elude it, but it 
comes with you, You want to employ it, but you are its tool; you 
want to think about it, but your thoughts obey it. finally the 
fear of the inescapable seizes you, for it comes after you slowly 
and invincibly 

There is no escape. So it is that you come to know what a real 
God is. Now you'll think up clever truisms, preventive measures 
secret escape routes, excuses, potions capable of inducing 
forgetfulness, but it’s all useless. The fire burns right through 
you. That which guides forces you onto the way. 


But the way is my own self, my own life founded upon myself 
‘The God wants my life. He wants to go with me, sit at the table 
with me, work with me. Above all he wants to be ever-present." 
But I'm ashamed of my God. I don't want to be divine but 
reasonable, The divine appears to me as irrational craziness. I hate 
it as an absurd disturbance of my meaningful human activity. It 
seems an unbecoming sickness which has stolen into the regular 
course of my life. Yes, I even find the divine superfluous. / [Image

Divine Folly” 


Cap. xix. 


[HI 98] 1 am standing in a high hall. Before me I see a green 
curtain between two columns. The curtain parts easily. I see into 
a small deep room with bare walls, There is a small window with 
bluish glass above. I set foot on the stair leading up to this room 
between the pillars and enter. In the rear wall, I see a door right 
and left. It’ as if I must choose between right and left 

1 choose the right. The door is open, I enter: I'm in the reading 
room of a large library. In the background sits a small chin man 
of pale complexion, apparently the librarian, The atmosphere 
is troubling—scholarly ambitions—scholarly conceit—wounded 
scholarly vanity. Apart from the librarian I see no one. I step 
toward him, He looks up from his book and says, “What do 
you wane” 

T’m somewhat embarrassed, since I don’t know what I really 
want: Thomas & Kempis crosses my mind. 

I: “Td like to have Thomas 4 Kempis’s The Imitation of Christ." 

He looks at me somewhat astonished as if he didn’t credit me 
with such an interest; he gives me an order-form to fill out. I 100 
think that it’s astonishing to ask for Thomas & Kempis. 

“Ase you surprised that I’m requesting Thomas's work?” 

“Wall, yes, the book is seldom asked for, and I wouldn't have 
expected this interest from you.” 

“[ must confess that I'm also somewhat surprised by this 
inspiration, but recently I came across a passage from Thomas 
that made a particular impression on me. Why, I can't really say. If 


1 remember correctly, it dealt with the problem of the Imitation 
of Christ.” 

“Do you have particular theological or philosophical 
interests, or—" 

“Do you mean—whether I want to read it for the purpose 
of prayer?” 

“Well, hardly.” 

“If I read Thomas & Kempis, I do so for the sake of prayer, or 
something similar, rather than out of scholarly interest.” 

“Are you that religious? I had no idea.” 

“You know that I value science extraordinarily highly. But 
there are actually moments in life where science also leaves us 
empty and sick. In such moments a book like Thomas's means 
very much to me since it is written from the soul.” 

“But somewhat old-fashioned. We can no longer get involved 
in Christian dogmatics these days, surely.” 

“We haven't come to an end with Christianity by simply putting 
it aside. It seems to me that there's more to it than we see.” 

“What is there about it? It’s just a religion.” / 

“For what reasons and morcover at what age do men set it 
aside? Presumably, most do so during their student days or perhaps 
even earlier. Would you call that a particularly discriminating 
age? And have you ever examined more closely the grounds 
on which people put aside positive religion? The grounds are 
mostly dubious, such as that the contents of belief clash with 
natural science or philosophy.” 

“In my view, such an objection should not necessarily be 
rejected out of hand, despite the fact that there are better reasons. 
For example, I consider the lack of a true and proper sense of

actuality in religion a disadvantage. Incidentally. a host of substitutes 
now exists for the loss of opportunity for prayer caused by the 
collapse of religion. Nietzsche, for example, has written a more 
than veritable book of prayer," not to mention Faust.” 

“I suppose that’s correct in a certain sense, But especially 
Nietzsche's truth strikes me as too agitated and provocative it’s 
good for those who are yet to be set free. For that reason his truth 
is good only for them. I believe that I've recently discovered that 
wwe also need a truth for those who are forced into a corner. It's 
possible that instead they need a depressive truth, which makes man 
smaller and more inward.” 

“Forgive me, but Nietzsche interiorizes man exceptionally well.” 

“Perhaps from your standpoint you're right, but I can’t help 
feeling that Nietzsche speaks to those who need more freedom, 
not to those who clash strongly with life, who bleed from wounds, 
and who hold fast to actualities.” 

“But Nietzsche confers a precious feeling of superiority upon 
such people.” 

“I can’t dispute that, but I know men who need inferiority, not 
superiority.” 

“You express yourself very paradoxically. I don't understand 
you. Inferiority can hardly be a desideratum.” 

“Perhaps you'll understand me better if instead of inferiority 
1 say resignation, a word that one used to hear a lot of, but 
seldom anymore.” 

“It also sounds very Christian.” 

“As I said, there seem to be all sorts of things in Christianity 
that maybe one would do well to keep. Nietzsche is too 
oppositional. Like everything healthy and long-lasting, truth 
unfortunately adheres more to the middle way, which we 
unjustly abhor.” 

“TL really had no idea that you take such a mediating position.” 

“Neither did I—my position is not entirely clear to me. If I 
mediate, I certainly mediate in a very peculiar mannes.” 

‘At this moment the servant brought the book, and I took my 
leave from the librarian. 


[2] The divine wants to live with me. My resistance is in vain. 
1 asked my thinking, and it said: “Take as your model one that 
shows you how to live the divine.” Our natural model is Christ. 
‘We have stood under his law since antiquity, first outwardly, and 
then inwardly. At first we knew this, and then knew it no longer, 
We fought against Christ, we deposed him, and we seemed to be 
conquerors. But he remained in us and mastered us. 

It is better to be thrown into visible chains than into invisible 
ones. You can certainly leave Christianity but it does not leave 
you. Your liberation from it is delusion, Christ is the way. You 
can certainly run away, but then you are no longer on the way. 
The way of Christ ends on the cross, Hence we are crucified

with him in ourselves, With him, we wait until we die for our 
resurrection. With Christ the living experience no resurrection, 
unless it occurs after death." 

If imitate Christ, he is always ahead of me and I can never 
reach the goal, unless I reach it in him. / But thus I move beyond 
myself and beyond time, in and through which I am as I am. I 
thus blunder into Christ and his time, which created him thus 
and not otherwise. And so I am outside my time, despite the 
fact that my life is in this time and I am split between the life of 
Christ and my life that still belongs to this present time, But if I 
am truly to understand Christ, I must realize how Christ actually 
lived only his own life, and imitated no one. He did not emulate 
any model." 

IFT thus truly imitate Christ, I do not imitate anyone, I emulate 
no one, but go my own way, and I will also no longer call myself 
a Christian, Initially, I wanted to emulate and imitate Christ by 
living my life, while observing his precepts. A voice in me protested 
against this and wanted to remind me that my time also had its 
prophets who struggle against the yoke with which the past 
burdens us. I did not succeed in uniting Christ with the prophets of 
this time. The one demands bearing, the other discarding; the one 
commands submission, the other the will How should I think 
of this contradiction without doing injustice to either? What I 
could not conjoin in my mind probably lends itself to living one 
after the other. 

And so I decided to cross over into lower and everyday life, my 
life, and to begin down there, where I stood. 

‘When thinking leads to the unthinkable, it is time to return 
to simple life. What thinking cannot solve, life solves, and what 
action never decides is reserved for thinking, If I ascend to the 
highest and most difficult on the one hand, and seek to eke out 
redemption that reaches even higher, then the true way does not 
lead upward, but toward the depths, since only my other leads me 
beyond myself But acceptance of the other means a descent into 
the opposite, from seriousness into the laughable, from suffering 
into the cheerful, from the beautiful into the ugly, from the pure 
into the impure.

the cook—wearing a checkered apron. I greet her, somewhat 
astonished, She too seems embarrassed. I ask her: “May I sit down 
for awhile? It’s cold outside and I must wait for something.” 

“Please have a seat.” 

She wipes the table in front of me. Having nothing else to do, 
take out my Thomas and begin to read. The cook is curious and 
looks at me furtively, Every once in a while she goes past me. 

“Excuse me, are you perhaps a clergyman?” 

“No, why do you think so?” 

“Oh, I just thought you might be because you are reading a 
small black book. My mother, may God rest her soul, left me such 
a book.” 

“I see, and what book might that be?” 

“Iv is called The Imitation of Christ. It’s a very beautiful book 
1 often pray with it in the evenings.” 

“You have guessed well, I too am reading The Imitation of Christ.” 

“1 don’t believe that a man like you would read such a book 
unless he were a pastor.” 

“Why shouldn't I read it? It also does me good to read a 
proper book.” 

“My mother, God bless her, had it with her on her deathbed, 
and she gave it to me before she died.” 

I browse through the book absentmindedly while she is 
speaking. My eyes fll on the following / passage in the nineteenth 
chapter: "The righteous base their intentions more on the mercy 
of God, which in whatever they undertake they trust more than 
their own wisdom.” 

‘This is the intuitive method that Thomas recommends, it 
occurs to me.” I turn to the cook: “Your mother was a clever 
woman, and she did well to give you this book.” 

“Yes, indeed, it has often comforted me in difficult hours and 
it always provides good counsel.” 

I become immersed in my thoughts again: I believe one can 
also follow one’s own nose. That would also be” the intuitive 
method. But the beautiful way in which Christ does this must 
nevertheless be of special value. I would like to imitate Christan 
inner disquiet seizes me—what is supposed to happen? I hear 
an odd swishing and whirring—and suddenly a roaring sound 
fills the room like a horde of large birds—with a frenzied 
flapping of wings—T see many shadowlike human forms rush 
past and I hear a manifold babble of voices utter the words: 
“Let us pray in the temple!” 

“Where are you rushing off to?” I call out, A bearded 
man with tousled hair and dark shining eyes stops and turns 


toward me: “We are wandering to Jerusalem to pray at the most 
holy sepulches.” 

“Take me with you.” 

"You cannot join us, you have a body. But we are dead.” 

“Who are you?” 

“| am Ezechiel, and I am an Anabaptist." 

“Who are those wandering with you?” 

“These are my fellow believers.” 

“Why are you wandering?” 

“We cannot stop, but must make a pilgrimage to all the 
holy places.” 

“What drives you to this?” 

“| don't know. But it seems that we still have no peace, although 
wwe died in true belief” 

“Why do you have no peace if you died in true belief?” 

“Ie always seems to me as if we had not come to a proper end, 
with life.” 

“Remarkable—how so?” 

“It seems to me that we forgot something important that 
should also have been lived.” 

“And what was that?” 

“Would you happen to know?” 

With these words he reaches out greedily and uncannily 
toward me, his eyes shining as if from inner heat. 

“Let go, daimon, you did not live your animal.””* 

The cook is standing in front of me with a horrified face; she 
haas taken me by the arm and grips me firmly. “For God's sake,” she 
calls out, “Help, what's wrong with you? Are you in a bad way?” 

look at her astonished and wonder where I really am. But 
soon strange people burst in—among them the librarian— 
infinitely astonished and dismayed at first, then laughing 
maliciously: “Oh, I might have known! Quick, the police!” 

Before I can collect myself, I am pushed through a crowd 
of people into a van. I am still clutching my copy of Thomas and 
ask myself: “What would he say to this new situation?” I open 
the booklet and my eyes fall on the thirteenth chapter, where it 
says: “So long as we live here on earth, we cannot escape temp- 
tation. There is no man who is so perfect, and no saint so sacred, 
that he cannot be tempted on occasion. Yes, we can hardly be 
without temptation.” 

Wise Thomas, you always come up with the right answer. That 
crazy Anabaptist certainly had no such knowledge, or he might 
hhave made a peaceful end, He also could have read it in Cicero: 
rerum onium satictas vitae faci satictatem—satietas vitae tempus maturum

‘is man’ life on earth but atime of temptation? That is why we should treat our temptations a a serious matter and endeavor by vigilance and prayer to keep the devil 
from finding any loophole. Remember that the devil never sleeps, but goes about looking for his prey. There is no one so perfect and holy that he never meets temptation; 
we cannot escape it acagether” (p. 46). He goes on to emphasize the benefits of temptation, as bemig the means theough which a man is “humbled, purified and disciplined "

mortis affrt [satiety of all things causes satiety of life—one is 
satiated with life and the time is ripe for death]. This knowledge 
had evidently brought me into conflict with society. I was flanked 
by policemen left and right. “Well,” I said to them, “you can let 
me go now.” “Yes, we know all about this,” / one said laughing 
“Now just you hold your peace,” said the other sternly. So, we are 
obviously heading for the madhouse, That is a high price to pay 
But one can go this way too, it seems. It’s not so strange, since 
thousands of our fellows take that path, 


We have arrived—a large gate, a hall—a friendly bustling 
superintendent—and now also two doctors. One of them is a 
small fat professor. 

Pr: “What's that book you've got there?” 

“Irs Thomas a Kempis, The Imitation of Christ.” 

Pr: “So, a form of religious madness, perfectly clear, religious 
paranoia.”—You see, my dear, nowadays, the imitation of Christ 
leads to the madhouse.” 

“That is hardly to be doubted, professor.” 

Pr: “The man has wit—he is obviously somewhat maniacally 
aroused. Do you hear voices?” 

"You bet! Today it was a huge throng of Anabaptists that 
swarmed through the kitchen.” 

Pr: "Now, there we have it. Are the voices following you?” 

“Oh no, Heaven forbid, I summoned them.” 

Pr: “Ak, this is yet another case that clearly indicates that 
hallucinations directly call up voices. This belongs in the case 
history. Would you immediately make a note of that, doctor?” 

“With all due respect, Professor, may I say that it is absolutely 
not abnormal, but much rather the intuitive method.” 

Pr: “Excellent. The fellow also uses neologisms. Well—I 
suppose we have an adequately clear diagnosis. Anyway, I wish 
you a good recovery, and make sure you stay quiet.” 

“But professor, I’m not at all sick, I feel perfectly well” 

Pr: “Look, my dear, You don’t have any insight into your 
illness yet. The prognosis is naturally pretty bad, with at best 
limited recovery” 

Superintendent: “Professor, can the man keep the book?” 

Pr; “Well, I suppose so, as it seems to be a harmless 
prayer book.” 

Now my clothes are inventoried—then the bath—and now 
I'm taken off to the ward. I enter a large sickroom, where I'm 
told to get into bed, The person to my left is lying motionless 
with a transfixed gaze, while the one to the right appears to 
possess a brain whose girth and weight are shrinking. I enjoy 
perfect silence. The problem of madness is profound. Divine 
madness—a higher form of the irrationality of the life streaming 
through us—at any rate a madness that cannot be integeated into 
present-day society—but how? What if the form of society were 
integrated into madness? At this point things grow dark, and 
there is no end in sight.”*

[2] [HI 102] The growing plant sprouts a sapling on its 
right-hand side, and when this is completely formed, the natural 
urge to grow will not develop beyond the final bud but flows back 
{nto the stem, into the mother of the sprig, paving an uncertain 
way in the dark and through the stem, and finally finding the 
right position on the left where it sprouts a new sapling. But this 
new direction of growth is completely opposed to the previous 
one. And yet the plant nevertheless grows regularly in this way, 
without overstraining or disturbing its balance. 

‘On the right is my thinking, on the left is my feeling. 1 enter 
the space of my feeling which was previously unknown to me, 
and see with astonishment the difference between my two rooms. 
I cannot help laughing—many laugh instead of crying, I have 
stepped from the right foot onto the left, and wince, struck by 
inner pain. The difference between hot and cold is too great. I 
leave the spirit of this world which has thought Christ through 
to the end, and step over into that other funny-frightful realm in 
which I can find Christ again. 

The “imitation of Christ” led me to the master himself and to 
his astonishing kingdom, I do not know what I want there; I can 
only follow the master who governs this other realm in me, In 
this realm other laws are valid than the guidelines of my wisdom. 
Here, the “mercy of God,” which I had never relied on, for good 
practical reasons, is the highest law of action. The “mercy of 
God” signifies a particular / state of the soul in which I entrust 
myself to all neighbors with trembling and hesitation and with 
the mightiest outlay of hope that everything will work out well 

1 can no longer say that this or that goal should be reached, or 
that this or that reason should apply because itis good: instead I 
grope through mist and night. No line emerges, no law appears; 
instead everything is thoroughly and convincingly accidental, as 
a matter of fact even terribly accidental, But one thing becomes 
dreadfully clear, namely that contrary to my earlier way and all its 
insights and intentions, henceforth all is error. It becomes ever 
more apparent that nothing leads, as my hope sought to persuade 
me, but that everything misleads. 

And suiddenly to your shivering horror it becomes clear to you 
that you have fallen into the boundless, the abyss, the inanity of 
eternal chaos, It rushes toward you as if carried by the roaring 
‘wings of a storm, the hurtling waves of the sea 

Every man has a quiet place in his soul, where everything 
is self-evident and easily explainable, a place to which he likes 
to retire from the confusing possibilities of life, because there 
everything is simple and clear, with a manifest and limited 
purpose. About nothing else in the world can a man say with 
the same conviction as he does of this place: “You are nothing 
but...” and indeed he has said it 

‘And even this place is a smooth surface, an everyday wall, 
nothing more than a snugly sheltered and frequently polished 
crust over the mystery of chaos. If you break through this most 
everyday of walls, the overwhelming stream of chaos will flood

in, Chaos is not single, but an unending multiplicity. It is not 
formless, otherwise it would be single, but it is filled with 
figures that have a confusing and overwhelming effect due to 
their fullness.” 

“These figures are the dead, not just your dead, that is, all the 
images of the shapes you took in the past, which your ongoing life 
has left behind, but also the thronging dead of human history, 
the ghostly procession of the past, which is an ocean compared 
to the drops of your own life span. I see behind you, behind the 
mirror of your eyes, the crush of dangerous shadows, the dead, 
who look greedily through the empry sockets of your eyes, who 
moan and hope to gather up through you all the loose ends of 
the ages, which sigh in them, Your cluelessness does not prove 
anything. Put your ear to that wall and you will hear the rustling 
of their procession, 

Now you know why you lodged the simplest and most easily 
explained matters in just that spot, why you praised that peaceful 
seat as the most secure: so that no one, least of all yourself, 
would unearth the mystery there, For this is the place where 
day and night agonizingly merge. What you excluded from your 
life, what you renounced and damned, everything that was and 
could have gone wrong, awaits you behind that wall before which 
you sit quietly. 

Ifyou read the books of history, you will find men who sought 
the strange and incredible, who ensnared themselves and who 
‘were held captive by others in wolves’ lairs; men who sought the 
highest and the lowest, and who were wiped by fate, incomplete, 
from the tablets of the living. Few of the living know of them, and 
these few appreciate nothing about them, but shake their heads at 
such delusion. 

While you mock them, one of them stands behind you, panting 
from rage and despair at the fact that your stupor does not attend 
to him, He besieges you in sleepless nights, sometimes he takes 
hold of you in an illness, sometimes he crosses your intentions. 
He makes you overbearing and greedy, he pricks your longing for 
everything, which avails you nothing, he devours your success in 
discord. He accompanies you as your evil spirit, to whom you can 
grant no release 

Have you heard of those dark ones who roamed incognito 
alongside those who ruled che day, conspiratorially causing 
unrest? Who devised cunning things and did not shrink from any 
crime to honor their God? 

Beside them place Christ, who was the greatest among them. 
It-was too little for him to break the world, so he broke himself. 
‘And therefore he was the greatest of them all, and the powers 
of this world did not reach him. But I speak of the dead who 
fell prey to power, broken by force and not by themselves. Their 
hordes people the land of the soul. If you accept / them, they fill 
you with delusion and rebellion against what rules the world, From 
the deepest and from the highest they devised the most danger- 
ous things. They were not of a common nature, but fine blades of 
the hardest steel. They would have nothing to do with the small 
lives of men, They lived on the heights and accomplished the 
lowest. They forgot only one thing: they did not live their animal. 

‘The animal does not rebel against its own kind. Consider 
animals: how just they are, how well-behaved, how they keep 
to the time-honored, how loyal they are to the land that bears 
them, how they hold to their accustomed routes, how they care 


for their young, how they go together to pasture, and how they 
draw one another to the spring. There is not one that conceals 
its overabundance of prey and lets its brother starve as a result. 
There is not one that tries to enforce its will on those of its own 
kind, Not a one mistakenly imagines that it is an elephant when 
it is a mosquito. The animal lives fittingly and true to the life of its 
species, neither exceeding nor falling short of it 

He who never lives his animal must treat his brother like an 
animal. Abase yourself and live your animal so that you will be 
able to treat your brother correctly. You will thus redeem all those 
roaming dead who strive to feed on the living, And do not turn 
anything you do into a law, since that is the hubris of power!" 

‘When the time has come and you open the door to the dead, 
your horrors will also afflict your brother, for your countenance 
proclaims the disaster. Hence withdraw and enter solitude, since 
no one can give you counsel if you wrestle with the dead. Do not 
cay for help if the dead surround you, otherwise the living will 
take flight, and they are your only bridge to the day: Live the life 
of the day and do not speak of mysteries, but dedicate the night 
to bringing about the salvation of the dead. 

For whoever well-meaningly tears you away from the dead has 
rendered you the worst service, since he has torn your life branch 
from the tree of divinity. He also sins against restoring what 
wwas created and later subjugated and lost." “For the earnest 
expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the 
sons of God, For the creature was made subject to vanity, not 
willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in 
hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from 
the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children 
of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and 
travaileth in pain together until now.” 

Every step upward will restore a step downward so that the 
dead will be delivered into freedom. The creating of the new 
shrinks from the day since its essence is secret. It prepares the 
destruction of precisely this day in the hope of leading it over 
into a new creation. Something evil is attached to the creation 
of the new, which you cannot proclaim loudly. The animal that 
looks for new hunting grounds cowers slinking and sniffing on 
dark paths and does not want to be surprised. 

Please consider that it is the suffering of the creative that they 
carry something evil in them, a leprosy of the soul that separates 
them from its danger. They could praise their leprosy as a virtue 
and could indeed do so out of virtuousness. But this would be 
doing what Christ does, and would therefore be his imitation. 
For only one was Christ and only one could violate the laws as he 
did, Ie is impossible to commit higher infringements on his path. 
Fulfill that which comes to you. Break the Christ in yourself so 
that you may arrive at yourself and ultimately at your animal 
which is well-behaved in its herd and unwilling to infringe its 
laws, May it suffice in terms of transgression that you do not 
imitate Christ, since thereby you take a step back from Christianity 
and a step beyond it. Christ brought salvation through adeptness, 
and ineptitude will save you. 

Have you counted the dead whom the master of sacrifice 
honored? Have you asked them for whose sake they believe 
they have suffered death? Have you entered the beauty of their 
thoughts and the purity of their intention? “And they shall go forth, 
and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed 





179 Jung's marginal nore to the calligraphic volume: "26, 1.1919." ‘The date appears to refer to when this section was teanseribed into the calligraphic volume, 
180 In 1930, Jung said ina seminar: “We ate prejudiced in regard to the animal. People don't understand when I tell them they should become acquainted with thei animals 
‘or assimilate their animals. They think the animal is always jumping over walls and rising hell ll over town. Yet in nature the animal isa well-behaved citizen It is 


pious, it follows the path with great regularity, it does nothing extravagant. Only man is extra 





rt. So if you assimilate the charaeter of the animal you become = 


Peculily law-abiding citizen, you go very slowly, and you become very reasonable in your ways, in as much a you can aford it” (Vision 1, p. 168).

against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire 
bbe quenched.” 

Thus do penance, consider what fell victim to death for the 
sake of Christianity, lay it before you and force yourself to accept 
it. For the dead need salvation, The number of the unredeemed 
dead has become greater than the number of living Christians, 
therefore it is time that we accept the dead."” 

Do not throw yourself against what has become, enraged or 
bent on destruction. What will you put in its place? Do you not 
know that if you are successful in destroying what has become, 
you will then turn the will of destruction against yourself? But 
anyone who makes destruction their goal will perish through 
self-destruction, Much rather respect what has become, since 
reverence is a blessing. 

‘Then turn to the dead," listen to their lament and accept 
them with love, Be not their blind spokesman,"* / [Image 105}"* 
/ there are prophets who in the end have stoned themselves, But 
wwe seek salvation and hence we need to revere what has become 
and to accept the dead, who have fluttered through the air and 
lived like bats under our roofs since time immemorial. The new 
will be buile on the old and the meaning of what has become will 
become manifold. Your poverty in what has become you will thus 
deliver into the wealth of the future. 


What seeks to distance you from Christianity and its holy rule 
of love are the dead, who could find no peace in the Lord since 
their uncompleted work has followed them. A new salvation is always 
a restoring of the previously lost. Did not Christ himself restore 
bloody human sacrifice, which better customs had expelled from 
sacred practice since days of old? Did he not himself reinstate 
the sacred practice of the eating of human sacrifice? In your 
sacred practice that which earlier laws condemned will once again 
be included. 

However, just as Christ brought back human sacrifice and the 
eating of the sacrificed, all this happened to him and not to his 
brother, since Christ placed above it the highest law of love, so 
that no brother would come to harm as a result, but so that all 
could rejoice in the restoration. The same thing happened as in 
ancient times, but now under the law of love." So if you have no 
reverence for what has become, you will destroy the law of love."* 
‘And what will become of you then? You will be forced to restore 
what was before, namely violent deeds, murder, wrongdoing, and 
contempt of your brother, And one will be alien to the other, and 
confusion will rule 





182 This isa citation from Isaish 2466 


NOX SECUNDA | 297 


‘Therefore you should have reverence for what has become, so 
that the law of love may become redemption through the restoration 
of the lower and of the past, not perdition through the boundless 
mastery of the dead, But the spirits of those who die before 
their time will live, for the sake of our present incompleteness, 
in dark hordes in the rafters of our houses and besiege our ears 
with urgent laments, until we grant them redemption through 
restoring what has existed since ancient times under the rule 
of love 

‘What we call temptation is the demand of the dead who 
passed away prematurely and incomplete through the guilt of the 
good and of the law. For no good is so complete that it could not 
do injustice and break what should not be broken. 


We are a blinded race. We live only on the surface, only in 
the present, and think only of tomorrow. We deal roughly with 
the past in that we do not accept the dead. We want to work 
only with visible success. Above all we want to be paid, We would 
consider it insane to do hidden work that does not visibly serve 
men, There is no doubt that the necessity of life forced us to 
prefer only those fruits one can taste. But who suffers more from 
the tempting and misleading influence of the dead than those 
who have gone wholly missing on the surface of the world? 

There is one necessary but hidden and strange work—a 
major work—which you must do in secret, for the sake of the 
dead, He who cannot attain his own visible field and vineyard 
is held fast by the dead, who demand the work of atonement 
from him. And until he has fulfilled this, he cannot get to 
his outer work, since the dead do not let him, He shall have 
10 search his soul and act in stillness at their behest and complete 
the mystery, so that the dead will not let him. Do not look 
forward so much, but back and into yourself, so that you will not 
fail to hear the dead. 

It belongs t0 the way of Christ that he ascends with few 
of the living, but many of the dead, His work was the salvation 
of the despised and lost, for whose sake he was crucified berween 
two criminals

difficult, but this is precisely how you will discover the worth of 
your living companions. 

‘What the ancients did for their dead! You seem to believe 
that you can absolve yourself from the care of the dead, and 
from the work that they so greatly demand, since what is dead

is past. You excuse yourself with your disbelief in the immortality 
of the soul. Do you think that the dead do not exist because 
you have devised the impossibility of immortality? You believe 
in your idols of words. The dead produce effects, that is 
sufficient, In the inner world there is no explaining away, as 
little as you can explain away the sea in the outer world, You 
must finally understand your purpose in explaining away, namely 
to seek protection." 

I accepted the chaos, and in the following night, my soul 
approached me. / [Image 107] / 


Nox tertia” 


Cap. xvi 


[HI 108] »*My soul spoke to me in a whisper, urgently and 
alarmingly: “Words, words, do not make too many words. Be 
silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you 
admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely. 
mired in madness? Do you not want to recognize your madness 
and welcome it in a friendly manner? You wanted to accept every- 
thing So accept madness too, Let the light of your madness shine, 
and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised 
and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life.” 

I: "Your words sound hard and the task you set me is difficult” 

S:“If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, 
since it makes up such a great part of your nature.” 

I: "I didn’t know that this is so.” 

S: "Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid 
becoming its victim. Madness is a special form of the spirit and 
clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily 
life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly 
illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make 
rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That is its mystery 
and its unknown law, What you call knowledge is an attempt to 
impose something comprehensible on life.” 

I: “That all sounds very desolate, but nevertheless it prompts 
ime to disagree.” 

S:*You have nothing to disagree with—you are in the madhouse” 
‘There stands the fat little professor—had he spoken this way? 
And had I taken him for my soul? 

Prof: “Yes, my dear, you are confused. Your speech is 
completely incoherent.” 

I:“T too believe that I've completely lost myself. Am I really 
crazy? It's all terribly confusing,” 

Prof: “Have patience, everything will work out, Anyway, 
sleep well.” 

I:"Thank you, but I'm afraid.” 


Everything inside me is in utter disarray. Matters are becoming 
serious, and chaos is approaching. Is this the ultimate bottom? 
Is chaos also a foundation? If only there weren't these terrible 
waves, Everything breaks asunder like black billows. Yes, I see 


and understand: it is the ocean, the almighty nocturnal tide—a 
ship moves there—a large steamer—I'm just about to enter the 
smoking parlor—many people—beautiful clothes—they all look 
at me astonished —someone comes up to me and says:"What’s the 
matter? You look just like a ghost! What happened?” 

1: “Nothing—that is—I believe that I have gone crazy—the 
floor sways—everything moves 

Someone: “The sea is somewhat rough this evening, that’s 
all—have a hot toddy—you're seasick.” 

1: “You're right, I am seasick, but in a special way—I'm really 
in a madhouse.” 

Someone: “Well now, you're joking again, life is returning.” 

I: “Do you call that wit? Just now the professor pronounced 
me truly and utterly mad.” 

The fat little professor is actually sitting at a green-covered 
table playing cards. He turns toward me when he hears me speak 
and laughs: “Well, where did you get to? Come here. Would you 
like a drink too? You're quite a character, I must say. You've put 
all the ladies in quite a furry this evening.” 

I: “Professor, for me this is no longer a joke. Just now I was 
your patient—” 

The parlor erupts in unbridled laughter. 

Prof: “I hope that I haven't upset you too much.” 

I; “Well, to be committed is no small matter.” 

The person to whom I had been speaking before suddenly 
comes up to me and looks me in the face. He isa man with a black 
beard, a tousled head of hair, and dark shining eyes. He speaks to 
me vehemently: “Something worse happened to me, it’ five years 
now that I've been here.” 

1 realize that it is my neighbor, who has apparently awakened 
from his apathy and is now sitting on my bed. He goes on speaking 
fiercely and urgently: “But I am Nietzsche, only rebaptized, I am 
also Christ, the Savior, and appointed to save the world, but they 
won't let me.” 

I: “Who won't let you?” 

The foo: “The devil. We are in Hell. But of course, you haven't 
noticed it yet. I didn’t realize until the second year of my time 
here that the director is the devil” 

I: “You mean the professor? That sounds incredible.” 

The fool: “You're an ignoramus. I was supposed to marry the 
mother of God long ago. But the professor, that devil, has her 
in his power. Every evening when the sun goes down he gets her 
with child. In the morning before sunrise she gives birth to it. 
Then all the devils come together and kill the child in a gruesome 
/ [mage 109} / manner, I distinctly hear his cries.” 

I: “But what you have told me is pure mythology” 

The fool: “You're crazy and understand nothing of it. You 
belong in the madhouse. My God, why does my family always 
shut me in with crazy people? I'm supposed to save the world, 
I'm the Savior!” 

He lies down again and sinks back into his lassitude, I clutch 
the sides of my bed to protect myself against the terrible waves. 
I stare at the wall, so that I can at least latch onto something with 


anew, only to stumble again and mock and loathe yourself, bur definitely despise and pity yourself. But if you know what the dead demand, temptation will become the 
wwellsping of your best work, indeed of the work of salvation: When Chast ascended after completing his work, he led those up with him whe had died prematurely

my eyes. A horizontal line runs along the wall, which is painted a 
darker color beneath. A radiator stands in front of it—it is a railing 
and I can see the sea beyond it. The line is the horizon, And there 
the sun now rises in red glory, solitary and magnificent—in itis a 
cross from which a serpent hangs—or is it a bull, slit open, as at 
the slaughterhouse, or is it an ass? I suppose it is really a ram with 
a crown of thorns—or is it the crucified one, myself? The sun of 
martyrdom has arisen and is pouring bloody rays over the sea. 
This spectacle lasts a long time, the sun rises higher, its rays grow 
brighter™ and hotter and the sun burns down white on a blue sea 
The swell has subsided. A charitable and quiet summer dawn lies 
on the shimmering sea. The salty smell of water rises up. A faint 
wide surf breaks on the sand with a dull thunder, and returns 
incessantly, twelve times, the strokes of the world clock”™—the 
twelfth hour is complete. And now silence enters. No noise, no 
breeze, Everything is rigid and deathly still. 1 wait, secretly anx- 
ious. I see a tree arise from the sea, Its crown reaches to Heaven 
and its roots reach down into Hell, I am completely alone and dis- 
heartened and gaze from afar. It is as if all life had flown from 
me and completely passed into the incomprehensible and fearful. 
Lam utterly weak and incapable, “Salvation,” I whisper. A strange 
voice speaks: “There is no salvation here,” you must remain calm, 
or you will disturb the others. It is night and the other people want

lamp and sadness weighs on the room,

He says: "You don’t need to find a way now” 

He speaks the truth. The way, or whatever it might be, on 
which people go, is our way, the right way, There are no paved 
ways into the future. We say that it is this way, and it is, We 
build roads by going on. Our life is the truth that we seek. Only 
my life is the truth, the truth above all. We create the truth by 
living ie. 

Bl} This is the night in which all the dams broke, where what 
‘was previously solid moved, where the stones turned into serpents, 
and everything living froze. Is this a web of words? If itis, itis a 
hellish web for those caught in it. 

There are hellish webs of words, only words, but what are 
‘words? Be tentative with words, value them well, rake safe words, 
‘words without catches, do not spin them with one another so that 
no webs arise, for you are the first who is ensnared in them.” For 


NOX TERTIA | 299 


words have meanings. With words you pull up the underworld. 
Word, the paltriest and the mightiest. In words the emptiness 
and the fullness flow together. Hence the word is an image 
of God. The word is the greatest and the smallest that man 
created, just as what is created through man is the greatest and 
the smallest. 

So if I fall prey to the web of words, I fall prey to the greatest 
and the smallest. I am at the mercy of the sea, of the inchoate 
waves that are forever changing place. Their essence is movement 
and movement is their order. He who strives against waves is 
exposed to the arbitrary. The work of men is steady but it swims 
upon chaos, The striving of men seems like lunacy to him who 
comes from the sea, But men consider him mad.” He who comes 
from the sea is sick, He can hardly bear the gaze of men. For to 
him they all seem to be drunk and foolish from sleep-inducing 
poisons. They want to come to your rescue, and as for accepting 
help, for sure you would like less of that, rather than swindling 
your way into their company and being completely like one who 
has never seen the chaos but only talks about it 

But for him who has seen the chaos, there is no more hiding, 
because he knows that the bottom sways and knows what this 
swaying means. He has seen the order and the disorder of the 
endless, he knows the unlawful laws. He knows the sea and can 
never forget it. The chaos is terrible: days full of lead, nights 
fall of horror. 

Bur just as Christ knew that he was the way, the truth, and the 
life, in thar the new torment and the renewed salvation came into 
the world through him,” I know that chaos must come over men, 
and that the hands of those who unknowingly and unsuspectingly 
break through the thin walls that separate us from the sea are 
busy: For this is our way, our truth, and our life. 

Just as the disciples of Christ recognized that God had 
become flesh and lived among them as a man, we now recognize 
that the anointed of this time is a God who does not appear in 
the flesh; he is no man and yet is a son of man, but in spirit and 
not in flesh; hence he can be born only through the spirit of men 
as the conceiving womb of the God." What is done to this God 
you do to the lowest in yourself, under the law of love according 
to which nothing is cast out. For how else should your lowest be

but from pride, selfishness, and greed, is damned. None of the 
damnation is cast out either" 

Ifyou accept the lowest in you, suffering is unavoidable, since 
you do the base thing and build up what lay in ruin. There are 
‘many graves and corpses in us, an evil stench of decomposition" 
Just as Christ through the torment of sanctification subjugated 
the flesh, so the God of this time through the torment of 
sanctification will subjugate the spirit. Just as Christ tormented 
the flesh through the spirit, the God of this time will torment 
the spirit through the flesh. For our spirit has become an 
impertinent whore, a slave to words created by men and no 
longer the divine word itself™* 

The lowest in you is the source of mercy. We take this sickness 
upon ourselves, the inability to find peace, the baseness, and 
the contemptibility so that the God can be healed and radiantly 
ascend, purged of the decomposition of death and the mud of che 
underworld, The despicable prisoner will ascend to his salvation 
shining and wholly healed." 

Is there a suffering that would be too great to want to undergo 
for our God? You only see the one, and do not notice the other, 
But when there is one, so there is also another and that is the 
lowest in you. But the lowest in you is also the eye of the evil that 
stares at you and looks at you coldly and sucks your light down 
into the dark abyss. Bless the hand that keeps you up there, the 
smallest humanity, the lowest living thing, Quite a few would 
prefer death, Since Christ imposed bloody sacrifice on humanity, 
the renewed God will also not spare bloodshed, 


Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments 
like him that treadeth in the winefar? I have trodden the winepress 
alone and no one is with me. I have trodden myself down in my 
anger, and trampled upon myself in my fury. Hence my blood 
has spattered my clothes, and I have stained my robe. For I have 
afforded myself a day of vengeance, and the year to redeem 
myself has come. And I looked around, and there was none to 
help; and I wondered that there was no one who stood by me: 


therefore my own arm must save me, and my fury upheld me. 
And I trod myself down in my rage, and made myself drunk 
in my fury, and spilt my blood on the earth For I took my 
misdeed upon myself so that the God would be healed. 

Just as Christ said that he did not come to make peace but 
brought the sword," so he in whom Christ becomes complete 
will not give himself peace, but a sword. He will rebel against 
himself and one will be turned against the other in him. He will 
also hate that which he loves in himself. He will be castigated in 
himself, mocked, and given over to the torment of crucifixion, 
and no one will aid him or soothe his torment. 

Just as Christ was crucified between the two thieves, our 
lowest lies on either side of our way. And just as one thief went 
to Hell and the other rose up to Heaven, the lowest in us will be 
sundered in two halves on the day of our judgment. The one is 
destined for damnation and death, and the other will rise up. 
But it will take a long time until you see what is destined for 
death and what is destined for life, since the lowest in you is still 
unseparated and one, and in a deep sleep. 

If [accept the lowest in me, I lower a seed into the ground of 
Hell, The seed is invisibly small, but the tree of my life grows from 
it and conjoins the Below with the Above, At both ends there is 
fire and blazing embers. The Above is fiery and the Below is fiery. 
Between the unbearable fires grows your life. You hang between 
these two poles. In an immeasurably frightening movement the 
stretched hanging welters up and down." 

‘We thus fear our lowest, since that which one does not possess 
is forever united with the chaos and takes part in its mysterious 
ebb and flow. Insofar as I accept the lowest in me—precisely that 
red glowing sun of the depths—and thus fall victim to the 
confusion of chaos, the upper shining sun also rises, Therefore 
he who strives for the highest finds the deepest. 

To deliver the men of his time from the stretched hanging, 
Christ effectively took this torment upon himself and taught 
them: “Be crafty like serpents and guileless like doves,”*” For 
craftiness counsels against chaos, and guilelessness veils its

terrible aspect. Thus men could take the safe middle path, 
hedged both upward and downward, 

But the dead of the Above and the Below mounted, and their 
demands grew ever louder. And both the noble and the wicked 
rose up again and, unaware, broke the law of the mediator. They 
flung open doors both above and below. They drew many after 
them to higher and lower madness, thereby sowing confusion 
and preparing the way of what is to come 

But he who goes into the one and not also at the same time 
into the other by accepting what comes toward him, will simply 
teach and live the one and turn it into a reality: For he will be 
its victim. When you go into the one and hence consider the 
other approaching you as your enemy, you will fight against 
the other. You will do so because you fail to recognize that 
the other is also in you. On the contrary, you think that the 
other comes somehow from without and you think that you 
also catch sight of it in the views and actions of your fellow 
men which clash with yours. You thus fight the other and are 
completely blinded. 

But he who accepts what approaches him because it is also in 
hhim, quarrels and wrangles no more, but looks into himself and 
keeps silent. / [Image 113)" / 


He sees the tree of life, whose roots reach into Hell and whose 
top touches Heaven. He also no longer knows differences.” 
who is right? What is holy? What is genuine? What is 
good? What is correct? He knows only one difference: the 
difference between below and above. For he sees that the tree 
of life grows from below to above, and that it has its crown 
at the top, clearly differentiated from the roots. To him this is 
unquestionable, Hence he knows the way to salvation. 

To unlearn all distinctions save that concerning direction is 
part of your salvation, Hence you free yourself from the old curse 
of the knowledge of good and evil. Because you separated good 
from evil according to your best appraisal and aspired only to the 
good and denied the evil that you committed nevertheless and

failed to accept, your roots no longer suckled the dark nourishment 
of the depths and your tree became sick and withered. 

Therefore the ancients said that after Adam had eaten the 
apple, the tree of paradise withered.” Your life needs the dark. 
But if you know that itis evil, you can no longer accept it and you 
suffer anguish and you do not know why. Nor can you accept it as 
evil, else your good will reject you. Nor can you deny it since you 
know good and evil. Because of this the knowledge of good and 
evil was an insurmountable curse. 

But if you return to primal chaos and if you feel and recognize 
that which hangs stretched between the two unbearable poles of 
fire, you will notice that you can no longer separate good and evil 
conclusively, neither through feeling nor through knowledge, but 
that you can discern the direction of growth only from below to 
above. You thus forget the distinction between good and evil, and 
you no longer know it as long as your tree grows from below to 
above. But as soon as growth stops, what was united in growth 
falls apart and once more you recognize good and evil 

You can never deny your knowledge of good and evil to 
yourself, so that you could betray your good in order to live evil 
For as soon as you separate good and evil, you recognize them 
‘They are united only in growth. But you grow if you stand still in 
the greatest doubt, and therefore steadfastness in great doubt 
is a veritable flower of life 

He who cannot bear doubt does not bear himself. Such a one 
is doubtful; he does not grow and hence he does not live. Doubt 
is the sign of the strongest and the weakest. The strong have 
doubt, but doubt has the weak. Therefore the weakest is close 
to the strongest, and if he can say to his doubt: “I have you,” 
then he is the strongest. But no one can say yes to his doubt, 
unless he endures wide-open chaos, Because there are so many 
among us who can talle about anything, pay heed ro what they 
live. What someone says can be very much or very litele. Thus 
examine his life. 

My speech is neither light nor dark, since it is the speech of 
someone who is growing

Nox quarta” 


Cap. xvi 


[HI 114] “1 hear the roaring of the morning wind, which 
comes over the mountains. The night is overcome, when all my 
life was subject to eternal confusion and stretched out between 
the poles of fire 

My soul speaks to me in a bright voice: “The door should be 
lifted off its hinges to provide a free passage between here and 
there, between yes and no, between above and below, between 
lefe and right. Airy passages should be built between all opposed 
things, light smooth streets should lead from one pole to the other. 
Scales should be set up, whose pointer sways gently. A flame should 
burn that cannot be blown out by the wind. A stream should flow 
to its deepest goal. The herds of wild animals should move to their 
feeding grounds along their old game paths. Life should proceed, 
from birth to death, from death to birth, unbroken like the path 
of the sun, Everything should proceed on this path.” 

Thus speaks my soul. But I toy casually and terribly with 
myself. Is it day or night? Am I asleep or awake? Am I alive or 
have I already died? 

Blind darkness besieges me—a great wall—a gray worm of 
twilight crawls along it. It has a round face and laughs, The 
laughter is convulsive and actually relieving. I open my eyes: the 
fat cook is standing before me: “You're a sound sleeper, I must 
say. You've slept for more than an hour.” 

1: “Really? Have I slept? I.must have dreamed, what a dreadful 
play! Did I fall asleep in this kitchen? Is this really the realm 
of mothers?” 

“Have a glass of water, you're still thoroughly drowsy.” 

1: "Yes, this sleep can make one drunk. Where is my Thomas? 
‘There it lies, open at the twenty-first chapter: “My soul, in 
everything and yet beyond everything, you must find your rest in 
the Lord, for he is the eternal rest of the saints.”** 

1 read this sentence aloud. Is not every word followed by a 
question mark? 

“IF you fell asleep with this sentence, you must really have had. 
a beautiful dream.” 

I: “I certainly dreamed, and I will think about the dream. 
Incidentally, can you tell me whose cook you are?” 

“The librarian’s, He loves good cooking and I have been with 
him for many years.” / [Image 115} / 





I:“Oh, I had no idea that the librarian had such a cook.” 

“Yes, you must know that he’s a gourmet.” 

1: “Farewell, madam cook, and thank you for the accommodation.” 

“You are most welcome and the pleasure was entirely mine.” 

Now I am outside. So that was the librarian’s cook. Does he 
really know what food is prepared inside? He has certainly never 
gone in there for a temple sleep. I think that I'll return the 
‘Thomas a Kempis to him. I enter the library 

L: “Good evening, here you are again.” 

1: “Good evening, Sis, I've come to return the Thomas. I sat 
down for abit in your kitchen next door to read, without suspecting 
that it’s your kitchen.” 

L: “Please, there's no problem whatsoever. Hopefully my cook 
received you well.” 

1-“T can’t complain about the reception. I even had an afternoon 
sleep over Thomas” 

L: “That doesn't surprise me, These prayer books are 
terribly boring.” 

1: “Yes, for people like us. But your cook finds the little book 
very edifying,” 4 

L: “Well yes, for the cook.” 

I: “Allow me the indiscrete question: have you ever had an 
incubation sleep in your kitchen?” 

L: “No, I've never entertained such a strange idea.” 

I: “Let me say that you'd learn a lor that way about the nature 
of your kitchen. Good night, Sir!” 

After this conversation I left the library and went outside into 
the anteroom where I approached the green curtains. I pushed 
them aside, and what did I see? I saw a high-ceilinged hall before 
me—with a supposedly magnificent garden in the background— 
Klingsor’s magical garden, it occurred to me at once. I had 
entered a theater; those two over there are part of the play: 
Amfortas and Kundey, or rather, just what am I looking at? Ie is, 
the librarian and his cook, He is ailing and pale, and has a bad 
stomach, she is disappointed and furious. Klingsor is standing to 
the left, holding the feather the librarian used to tuck behind his 
ear, How closely Klingsor resembles me! What a repulsive play! 
But look, Parsifal enters from the left. How strange, he also looks 
like me. Klingsor venomously throws the feather at Parsifal. But 
the latter catches it calmly. 

‘The scene changes: It appears that the audience, in this case 
me, joins in during the last act. One must kneel down as the

[2] What would mockery be, if it were not true mockery? 
What would doubt be, if it were not true doubt? What would 
opposition be, it if were not true opposition? He who wants to 
accept himself must also really accept his other, But in the yes not 
every no is true, and in the no every yes isa lie, But since I can be 
in the yes today and in the no tomorrow, yes and no are both true 
and untrue. Whereas yes and no cannot yield because they exist, 
our concepts of truth and error can 

1 presume you would like to have certainty with regard to truth 
and error? Certainty within one or the other is not only possible, 
but also necessary, although certainty in one is protection and 
resistance against the other. If you are in one, your certainty 
about the one excludes the other. But how can you then reach 
the other? And why can the one not be enough for us? One 
cannot be enough for us since the other is in us. And if we 
were content with one, the other would suffer great need and 
afflice us with its hunger, But we misunderstand this hunger and 
still believe that we are hungry for the one and strive for it even 
more adamantly. 

Through this we cause the other in us to assert its demands 
conus even more strongly: If we are then ready to recognize the 
claim of the other in us, we can cross over into the other to satisfy 
it, But we can thus reach across, since the other has become 
conscious tous, Yet if our blinding through the one is strong, we 
become even more distant from the other, and a disastrous chasm 
between the one and the other opens up in us, The one becomes 
surfeited and the other becomes too hungry. The satiated grows 


NOX QUARTA | 303 


lazy and the hungry grows weak. And so we suffocate in fat, 
consumed by lack 

This is sickness, but you see a lot of this type. It must be so, 
but it need not be so. There are grounds and causes enough that 
it is so, but we also want it not / to be so. For man is afforded 
the freedom to overcome the cause, for he is creative in and of 
himself. If you have reached that freedom through the suffering 
of your spirit to accept the other despite your highest belief in 
the one, since you are it too, then your growth begins. 

If others mock me, it is nevertheless them doing this, and 
1 can attribute guilt to them for this, and forget to mock myself 
But he who cannot mock himself will be mocked by others. 
So accept your self-mockery so that everything divine and heroic 
falls from you and you become completely human, What is 
divine and heroic in you is a mockery to the other in you, For 
the sake of the other in you, set off your admired role which 
you previously performed for your own self and become who 
you are 

He who has the luck and misfortune of a particular talent 
falls prey to believing that he is this gift. Hence he is also often 
its fool. A special gift is something outside of me. I am not 
the same as it. The nature of the gift has nothing to do with 
the nature of the man who carries it. It often even lives at the 
expense of the bearer’s character. His character is marked by 
the disadvantage of his gift, indeed even through its opposite. 
Consequently he is never at the height of his gift but always 
beneath it. If he accepts his other he becomes capable of bearing 
his gift without disadvantage. But if he only wants to live in 
his gift and consequently rejects his other, he oversteps the 
mark, since the essence of his gift is extrahuman and a natural 
phenomenon, which he in reality is not. All the world sees his 
error, and he becomes the victim of its mockery: Then he says 
that others mock him, while it is only the disregard of his other 
that makes him ridiculous 

‘When the God enters my life, I return to my poverty for the 
sake of the God. I accept the burden of poverty and bear all my 
ugliness and ridiculousness, and also everything reprehensible 
in me. I thus relieve the God of all the confusion and absurdity 
that would befall him if I did not accept it. With this I prepare 
the way for the God’s doing, What should happen? Has the 
darkest abyss been emptied and exhausted? Or what stands and 
waits down there, impending and red-hot? [Image 117]

/ Which fire has not been put out and which embers are still 
ablaze? We sacrificed innumerable victims to the dark depths, 
and yet it still demands more. What is this crazy desire craving 
satisfaction? Whose mad cries are these? Who among the dead 
suffers thus? Come here and drink blood, so that you can speak 
Why do you reject the blood? Would you like milk? Or the red 
juice of the vine? Perhaps you would rather have love? Love for 
the dead? Being in love with the dead? Are you perhaps demanding 
the seeds of life for the faded thousand-year-old body of the 
underworld? An unchaste incestuous lust for the dead? Something 
that makes the blood run cold. Are you demanding a lusty 
commingling with corpses? I spoke of “acceptance’—but you 
demand “to seize, embrace, copulate?” Are you demanding the 
desecration of the dead? That prophet, you say lay on the child 
and placed his mouth on the child’s mouth, and his eyes on its 
eyes, and his hands on its hands and he thus splays himself over 
the boy, so that the child's body became warm, But he rose again 
and went here and there in the house before he mounted anew 
and spread himself over him again, The boy snorted seven times. 
Then the boy opened his eyes. So shall your acceptance be, 
so shall you accept, not cool, not superior, not thought out, 
not obsequious, not as a self-chastisement, but with pleasure, 
precisely with this ambiguous impure pleasure, whose ambiguity 
enables it to unite with the higher, with that holy-evil pleasure 
of which you do not know whether it be virtue or vice, with that 
pleasure which is lusty repulsiveness, lecherous fear, sexual 
immaturity. One wakens the dead with this pleasure. 

Your lowest is in a sleep resembling death and needs the 
warmth of life which contains good and evil inseparably and 
indistinguishably. That is the way of life; you can call it neither 
evil nor good, neither pure nor impure, Yer this is not the goal 
but the way and the crossing, It is also sickness and the beginning 
of recovery, It is the mother of all abominable deeds and all 
salutary symbols. It is the most primordial form of creation, the 
very first dark urge that flows through all secret hiding places 
and dark passages, with the unintentional lawfulness of water and 
from unexpected places in the loose soil, swelling from the finest 
cracks to fructify the dry soil. It is the very first, secret teacher 
of nature, teaching plants and animals the most astonishing and 
supremely clever skills and tricks, which we hardly know how 
to fathom. It is the great sage who has superhuman knowledge, 
who has the greatest of all the sciences, who makes order out 
of confusion, and who prophesies the future clairvoyantly out of 
‘ungraspable fullness. It is the serpentlike, perishable and beneficial, 
the dreadfully and ridiculously daimonic. It is the arrow that 
always hits the weakest spot, the spring root which opens the 
sealed treasure chambers. 

‘You can call it neither clever nor stupid, neither good nor evil, 
since its nature is inhuman throughout. Ie is the son of the earth, 
the dark one whom you should awaken. It is man and woman 
at the same time and immature sex, rich in interpretation and 
misinterpretation, so poor in meaning and yet so rich, This is the 


dead that cried loudest, that stood right at the bottom and waited, 
that suffered worst, It desired neither blood nor milk nor wine 
for the sacrifice of the dead, but the willingness of our flesh, Its 
longing paid no heed to the torment of our spirit which struggled 
and tortured itself to devise what cannot be devised, that hence 
tore itself apart and sacrificed itself, Not until our spirit lay 
dismembered on the altar did I hear the voice of the son of the 
arth, and only then did I see that he was the great suffering one, 
‘who needed salvation. He is the chosen one since he was the most 
rejected. Ie is bad to have to say this, but perhaps I hear badly, or 
perhaps I misunderstand what the depths say. It is miserable to 
say as much, and yet I must say it 

‘The depths are silent. He has arisen and now beholds the light 
of the sun and is among the living, Restlessness and discord rose 
up with him, doubt and the fullness of life 

‘Amen, itis finished, What was unreal is real, what was real is 
unreal. However, I may not, I do not want to, I cannot. Oh human 
wretchedness! Oh unwillingness in us! Oh doube and despair. 
This is really Good Friday, upon which the Lord died and descended 
into Hell and completed the mysteries This is the Good Friday 
when we complete the Christ in us and we descend to Hell 
ourselves. This the Good Friday on which we moan and cry to will 
the completion of Christ, for after his completion we go to Hell. 
Christ was so powerful that his realm covered all the world and 
only Hell lay outside it 

Who succeeded in crossing the borders of this realm with 
‘good grounds, pure conscience, and obeying the law of love? 
Who among the living is Christ and journeys to Hell in living 
flesh? Who is it that expands the realm of Christ with Hell? 
Who is it that is full of drunkenness while sober? Who is it that 
descended from being one into being two? Who is it that tore 
apart his own heart to unite what has been separated?

asked her to dive down into the floods, whose distant roaring I could 
hear. This happened on 22 January of the year 1914, as recorded

a shot, and from the depths she called out: “Will you accept what

small garden is better than an ill-tended large garden. Both 
gardens are equally small when faced with the immeasurable, 
but unequally cared for.”

[2] From the flooding darkness the son of the earth had 
brought, my soul gave me ancient things that pointed to the 
future. She gave me three things: The misery of war, the darkness 
of magic, and the gift of religion. 

If you are clever, you will understand that these three things 
belong together. These three mean the unleashing of chaos and 
its power, just as they also mean the binding of chaos. War is 
obvious and everybody sees it. Magic is dark and no one sees 
it, Religion is still to come, but it will become evident. Did you 
think that the horrors of such atrocious warfare would come 
over us? Did you think that magic existed? Did you think about 
a new religion? I sat up for long nights and looked ahead at what 
‘was to come and I shuddered. Do you believe me? I am not too 
concerned, What should I believe? What should I disbelieve? I 
saw and I shuddered. 

But my spirit could not grasp the monstrous, and could not 
conceive the extent of what was to come. The force of my longing 
languished, and powerless sank the harvesting hands, I felt the 
burden of the most terrible work of the times ahead. I saw where 
and how, but no word can grasp it, no will can conquer it. I could 
not do otherwise, I let it sink again into the depths. 

1 cannot give it to you, and I can speak only of the way of what 
is to come. Little good will come to you from outside. What will 
come to you lies within yourself But what lies there! I would like 
to avert my eyes, close my ears and deny all my senses; I would like 
to be someone among you, who knows nothing and who never saw 
anything, It is too much and too unexpected. But I saw it and my 
memory will not leave me alone. Yet I curtail my longing, which 
‘would like to stretch out into the future, and I return to my small 
garden that presently blooms, and whose extent I can measure, It 
shall be well-tended. 


The futuce should be left to those of the future. I return t0 
the small and the real, for this is the great way, the way of what 
is to come. I return to my simple reality, to my undeniable and 
most minuscule being. And I take a knife and hold court over 
everything that has grown without measure and goal. Forests have 
grown around me, winding plants have climbed up me, and I am 
completely covered by endless proliferation, The depths are inex- 
haustible, they give everything, Everything is as good as nothing 
Keep a little and you have something. To recognize and know your 
ambition and your greed, to gather / [Image 125] / your craving, 
to cultivate it, grasp it, make it serviceable, influence it, master it, 
order it, to give it interpretations and meanings, is extravagant. 

It is lunacy, like everything that transcends its boundaries 
How can you hold that which you are not? Would you realy like 
to force everything which you are not under the yoke of your 
wretched knowledge and understanding? Remember that you can 
know yourself, and with that you know enough. But you cannot 
know others and everything else. Beware of knowing what lies 
beyond yourself, or else your presumed knowledge will suffocate 
the life of those who know themselves. A knower may know 
himself, That is his limit. 

With a painful slice I cut off what I pretended to know about 
what lies beyond me. I excise myself from the cunning interpretive 
loops that I gave to what lies beyond me. And my knife cuts even 
deeper and separates me from the meanings that I conferred upon 
myself I cut down to the marrow, until everything meaningful 
falls from me, until [am no longer as I might seem to myself, until 
I know only that I am without knowing what I am, 

T want to be poor and bare, and I want to stand naked before 
the inexorable. I want to be my body and its poverty. I want to be 
from the earth and live its law. I want to be my human animal and 
accept all its frights and desires. I want to go through the wail- 
ing and the blessedness of the one who stood alone with a poor 
unarmed body on the sunlit earth, a prey of his drives and of the 
Jucking wild animals, who was terrified by ghosts and dreaming 
of distant Gods, who belonged to what was near and was enemy 
to the far-off, who struck fire from stones, and whose herds were 
stolen by unknowable powers that also destroyed the crops of his 
fields, and who neither knew nor recognized, but who lived by 
what lay at hand, and received by grace what lay far-off,

understand the connection among Ka, Philemon, andthe other gues, and to establish the right relation to them. On October 15 1920, Jung discussed an unidentified

The 2 figures on either side are personifications of dominant ‘fathers’ The one isthe creative father, Ka, the other, Philemon that one whom gives form and law (the

warned, instructed, and undaunted—ourwardly striving to lead afl human life (p42) 

2335 These lines refer to the end of Voltaie's Candide “Al that is well said—bur we must cultivate our garden" (Candide ond Other Store. R. Pearson [Onford: Oxford

237 The scene inthe landscape resembles one of Jung’s waking 
ship with sails anda steamer, a medieval town, a caste with 

















xasies during his childhood in which Alsace is submerged by water, Basle is turned into a port, there is 
mons and soldiers and inhabitant ofthe town, and canal (Menoris, p. 100)

He was a child and unsure, yet full of certainty, weak and yet 
blessed with enormous strength. When his God did not help, he 
took another. And when this one did not help either, he castigated 
him. And behold: the Gods helped one more time. Thus I discard 
everything that was laden with meaning, everything divine and 
devilish with which chaos burdened me. Teuly, itis not up to me 
to prove the Gods and the devils and the chaotic monsters, to feed 
them carefully, to warily drag them with me, to count and name 
them, and to protect them with belief against disbelief and doubt. 

‘A free man knows only free Gods and devils that are self- 
contained and take effect on account of their own force. If they 
fail to have an effect, that is their own business, and I can 
remove this burden from myself. But if they are effective, they 
need neither my protection nor my care, nor my belief. Thus you 
may wait quietly to see whether they work. But if they do, be 
clever, for the tiger is stronger than you. You should be able to 
cast everything from you, otherwise you are a slave, even if you 
are the slave of a God. Life is free and chooses its way. It is limited 
enough, so do not pile up more limitation, Hence I cut away 
everything confining. I stood here, and there lay the riddlesome 
multifariousness of the world. 


And a horror crept over me. Am I not the tightly bound? Is, 
the world there not the unlimited? And I became aware of my 
weakness. What would poverty, nakedness and unpreparedness 
be without consciousness of weakness and without horror at 
powerlessness? Thus I stood and was terrified. And then my soul 
whispered to me:

1: "A ringing? What? I hear nothing” 

S: “Listen harder” 

1: “Perhaps something in the left ear. What could it mean?” 

Si “Misfortune.” 

I: "I accept what you say. I want to have fortune and misfortune” 

S:*Wel, then, raise your hands and receive what comes to you.” 

I: “What is it? A rod? A black serpent? A black rod, formed 
like a serpent—with two pearls as eyes—a gold bangle around its 
neck, Is it not like a magical rod?” 

S: “It is a magical rod.” 

I: “What should I do with magic? Is the magical rod a 
misfortune? Is magic a misfortune?” 

Si "Yes, for those who possess it.” 

I: “That sounds like the sayings of old—how strange you are,

THE GIFT OF MAGIC | 307 


S: “Magic is not easy, and it demands sacrifice.” 

I: “Does it demand the sacrifice of love? Of humanity? If it 
does, take the rod back” 

Si “Don’t be rash. Magic doesn’t demand that sacrifice. It 
demands another sacrifice.” 

I: “What sacrifice is that?” 

Si “The sacrifice that magic demands is solace.” 

I: “Solace? Do I understand correctly? Understanding you is 
unspeakably difficult. Tell me, what does this mean?” 

S: "Solace is to be sacrificed.” 

I: “What do you mean? Should the solace that I give or the 
solace that I receive be sacrificed?” 

S: “Both.” 

1: "I’m confused. This is too dark.” 

S: “You must sacrifice solace for the sake of the black rod, the 
solace you give and the solace you receive.” 

I: “Are you saying that I shouldn't be allowed to receive the 
solace of those I love? And should give no solace to those I love? 
This means the loss of a piece of humanity, and what one calls 
severity toward oneself and others takes its place.”*” 

S: “That is how it is.” 

I: “Does the rod demand this sacrifice?” 

S. "It demands this sacrifice.” 

I: “Can I, am I allowed to make this sacrifice for the sake of 
the rod? Must I accept the rod?” 

S: “Do you want to or not?” 

I: "I can't say, What do I know about the black rod? Who gives 
it to me?” 

S: “The darkness that lies before you. It is the next thing that 
‘comes to you. Will you accept it and offer it your sacrifice?” 

I: Iris hard to sacrifice to the dark, to the blind darkness—and 
what a sacrifice!” 

S: "Nature—does nature offer solace? Does it accept solace?” 

1: “You venture a heavy word. What solitude are you asking 
of me?” 

S: "This is your misfortune, and—the power of the black rod.” 

I: “How gloomily and full of foreboding you speak! Are you 
sheathing me in the armor / [Image 127}*° / of icy severity? Are 
you clasping my heart with a bronze carapace? I'm happy with 
the warmth of life, Should I miss it? For the sake of magic? 
‘What is magic?” 

S: "You don’t know magic. So don't judge. What are you 
bristling at?” 

I: "Magic! What should I do with magic? I don’t believe in it, I 
can't believe in it. My heart sinks—and I'm supposed to sacrifice 
a greater part of my humanity to magic? 

S: "I advise you, don’t struggle against this, and above all don't 
act so enlightened, as if deep down you did not believe in magic.” 

I: “You're inexorable. But I can’t believe in magic, or maybe I 
have a completely false idea of i.” 

S: “Yes, I gather that from what you're saying. Cast aside 
your blind judgment and critical gesture, otherwise you'll never 
understand, Do you still mean to waste years waiting?” 

I: “Be patient, my science has not yet been overcome.” 

S: “High time that you overcame it!” 


239 In Ecce Home, Niewsche wrote: “Every acquisition, every stop forward in knowledge isthe result of courage, of severity toward oneself, of cleanliness with respect 10

240 Inscription on top: ‘Amor tiumphat.” Inscription at bottom: “This image was completed on 9 January 1921, after it had waited incomplete for 9 months. It expresses 
know not what kind of grief, a fourfold sacrifice I could almost choose not to finish it. Iris the inexorable wheel ofthe four functions, the essence of al living beings 
imbued with sacrifice.” The functions are those of thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition, which Jung wrote about in Psyctlogal Types (1921), On February 23, 
1920, Jung noted in BlackBook 7:"What occurs berween the over and the beloved i the entie fullness of the Godhead. Both are unfathomable riddles to each other

friend Hermann Sigg, returning on April 17

1: "You ask a great deal, almost too much. After all—is science 
essential to life? Is science life? There are people who live without 
science. But to overcome science for the sake of magic? Thav’s 
uncanny and menacing,” 

S:Are you afraid? Don’t you want to risk life? Isn't it life that 
presents you with this problem?” 

1: "All this leaves me so dazed and confused. Won't you give me 
an enlightening word?” 

S: “Oh, s0 it’s solace you long for? Do you want the rod or 
don’t you?” 

I: “You tear my heart to pieces. I want to submit to life. But 
how difficult this is! I want the black rod because it is the first 
thing the darkness grants me. I don’t know what this rod means, 
nor what it gives—T only feel what it takes. I want to kneel down, 
and receive this messenger of darkness. I have received the black. 
rod, and now I hold it, the enigmatic one, in my hand; itis cold 
and heavy, like iron. The pearl eyes of the serpent look at me 
blindly and dazalingly. What do you want, mysterious gift? All che 
darkness of all former worlds crowds together in you, you hard, 
black piece of steel! Are you time and fate? The essence of nature, 
hard and eternally inconsolable, yet the sum of all mysterious 
creative force? Primordial magic words seem to emanate from 
you, mysterious effects weave around you, and what powerful arts 
slumber in you? You pierce me with unbearable tension—what 
grimaces will you make? What terrible mystery will you create? 
Will you bring bad weather, storms, cold, thunder and lightning, 
orwill you make the fields fruitful and bless the bodies of pregnant 
women? What is the mark of your being? Or don’t you need that, 
you son of the dark womb? Do you content yourself with the 
hhazy darkness, whose concretion and crystal you are? Where in 
my soul do I shelter you? In my heart? Should my heart be your 
shrine, your holy of holies? So choose your place. I have accepted 
you. What crushing tension you bring with you! Isn't the bow of 
‘my nerves breaking? I've taken in the messenger of the night.” 

S:"The most powerful magic lives in it.” 

I:"I feel it and yet can’t put into words the nightmarish power 
‘granted to it. I wanted to laugh, because so much alters in laugh- 
ter, and resolves itself only there. But laughter dies in me. The 
magic of this rod is as solid as iron and as cold as death. Forgive 
me, my soul, I don’t want to be impatient, but it seems to me that 
something has got to happen to break through this unbearable 
tension that came with the rod.” 

S: “Wait, keep your eyes and ears open.” 

I:*T'm shuddering, and I don't know why” 

S: "Sometimes one must shudder before—the greatest.” 

1:“I bow, my soul, before unknown forces—Tid like to consecrate 
an altar to each unknown God. I must submit. The black iron 
in my heart gives me secret power. It’s like defiance and like— 
contempt for men.”*" 

[2] Oh dark act, violation, murder! Abyss, give birth to the 
unredeemed. Who is our redeemer? Who our leader? Where are 
the ways through black wastes? God, do not abandon us! What 
are you summoning, God? Raise your hand up to the darkness 


above you, pray, despair, wring your hands, kneel, press your 
forehead into the dust, cry out, but do not name Him, do not 
Jook at Him, Leave Him without name and form, What should 
form the formless? Name the nameless? Step onto the great way 
and grasp what is nearest. Do not look out, do not want, but lift 
up your hands. The gifts of darkness are full of riddles. The way 
is open to whomever can continue in spite of riddles. Submit 
to the riddles and the thoroughly incomprehensible, There are 
dizzying / [Image 129] / bridges over the eternally deep abyss. 
But follow the riddles 

Endure them, the terrible ones, Itis still dark, and the terrible 
goes on growing, Lost and swallowed by the streams of procreating 
life, we approach the overpowering, inhuman forces that are busily 
creating what is to come. How much future the depths carry! Are 
not the threads spun down there over millennia? Protect the 
riddles, bear them in your heart, warm them, be pregnant with 
them. Thus you carry the future. 

The tension of the future is unbearable in us. It must break 
through narrow cracks, it must force new ways. You want t0 cast 
off the burden, you want to escape the inescapable. Running away 
is deception and detour. Shut your eyes so that you do not see the 
manifold, the outwardly plural, the tearing away and the tempting, 
There is only one way and that is your way; there is only one salva- 
tion and that is your salvation, Why are you looking around for 
help? Do you believe that help will come from outside? What is to 
come is created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do 
not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours, All other 
‘ways deceive and tempt you, You must fulfill the way thar i in you. 

Oh, that all men and all their ways become strange to you! 
‘Thus might you find them again within yourself and recognize 
their ways. But what weakness! What doubt! What fear! You will 
not bear going your way: You always want to have at least one foot 
con paths not your own to avoid the great solitude! So that maternal 
comfort is always with you! So that someone acknowledges you, 
recognizes you, bestows trust in you, comforts you, encourages 
you. So that someone pulls you over onto their path, where you 
stray from yourself, and where it is easier for you to set yourself 
aside. As if you were not yourself! Who should accomplish your 
deeds? Who should carry your virtues and your vices? You do not 
come to an end with your life, and the dead will besiege you 
terribly to live your unlived life. Everything must be fulfilled. 
Time is of the essence, so why do you want to pile up the lived 
and let the unlived rot? 


Great is the power of the way In it Heaven and Hell grow 
together, and in it the power of the Below and the power of the 
Above unite. The nature of the way is magical, as are supplication 
and invocation; malediction and deed are magical if they occur 
con the great way. Magic is the working of men on men, but your 
‘magic action does not affect your neighbor, it affects you first, and 
only if you withstand it does an invisible effect pass from you to 
your neighbor. There is more of it in the air than I ever thought 
However, it cannot be grasped, Listen:

All peoples are stil far off and stand behind the wall of darknes. 

But I hear his words, which reach me from afar.

become white. It wound itself around the head of the dead one 
like a diadem, and a light gleamed above his head, and the sun 
rose shining in the east. I stood and watched and was confused 
and a great weight burdened my soul. But the white bird that 
sat on my shoulder spoke to me: “Let it rain, let the wind blow, 
let the waters flow and the fire burn, Let each thing have its 
development, let becoming have its day” 


[2] 2. Truly, the way leads through the crucified, that means 
through him to whom it was no small thing to live his own life, 
and who was therefore raised to magnificence. He did not simply 
teach what was knowable and worth knowing, he lived it, Ie is 
unclear how great one’s humility must be to take it upon oneself 
to live one’s own life. The disgust of whoever wants to enter 
into his own life can hardly be measured. Aversion will sicken 
hhim. He makes himself vomit. His bowels pain him and his brain 
sinks into lassitude, He would rather devise any trick to help him 
escape, since nothing matches the torment of one’s own way: It 
scems impossibly difficult, so difficult that nearly anything seems 
preferable to this torment, Not a few choose even to love people 
for fear of themselves, I believe, too, that some commit a crime 
to pick a quarrel with themselves. Therefore I cling to everything 
that obstructs my way to myself 

3. He who goes to himself, climbs down, Pathetic and ridicu- 
lous forms appeared to the greatest prophet who came before 
this time, and these were the forms of his own essence. He did 
not accept them, but exorcized them before others. Ultimately, 
however, he was forced to celebrate a Last Supper with his own 
poverty and to accept these forms of his own essence out of 
compassion, which is precisely that acceptance of the lowest in 
us. Bur this enraged the mighty lion, who chased down the lost 
and restored it to the darkness of the depths And like all those 
with power, the one with the great name wanted to erupt from the 
‘womb of the mountain like the sun, But what happened to him? 
His way led him before the crucified and he began to rage. He raged 
against the man of mockery and pain because the power of his own 
essence forced him to follow precisely this way as Christ had 
done before us. Yet he loudly proclaimed his power and great- 
ness, No one speaks louder of his power and greatness than he 
from whom the earth disappears under his feet. Ultimately the 
lowest in him got to him, his incapacity, and this crucified his 
spirit, so that, as he himself had predicted, his soul died before 
his body: 


4. No one sises above himself who has not turned his most 
dangerous weapon against himself, One who wants to rise above 
himself shall climb down and hoist himself onto himself and lug 
himself to the place of sacrifice. But what must happen to a man 
until he realizes that outer visible success, that he can grasp with 
his hands, / leads him astray. What suffering must be brought 
upon humanity, until man gives up satisfying his longing for 
power over his fellow man and forever wanting others to be the 
same, How much blood must go on flowing until man opens his 
eyes and sees the way to his own path and himself as the enemy, 
and becomes aware of his real success, You ought to be able to 
live with yourself, but not at your neighbor's expense. The herd 
animal is not his brother's parasite and pest. Man, you have even. 
forgotten that you too are an animal. You actually still seem to 
believe that life is better elsewhere, Woe unto you if your neighbor 
also thinks so, But you may be sure that he does, Someone must 
begin to stop being childish. 

5. Your craving satisfies itself in you. You can offer no more 
precious a sacrificial meal to your God than yourself. May your 
greed consume you, for this wearies and calms it, and you will 
sleep well and consider the sun of each day as a gift. Ifyou devour 
other things and other people, your greed remains eternally 
dissatisfied, for it craves more, the most costly—it craves you. 
And thus you compel your desire to take your own way. You 
may ask others provided that you need help and advice. But you 
should make demands on no one, neither desiring nor expect- 
ing anything from anyone except from yourself. For your craving 
satisfies itself only within you. You are afraid of burning in your 
own fire. May nothing prevent you from doing so, neither any one 
else's sympathy nor your more dangerous sympathy with yourself 
Since you should live and die with yourself 

6. When the flame of your greed consumes you, and nothing 
remains of you but ash, so nothing of you was steadfast. Yet the 
flame in which you consumed yourself has illuminated many. But 
ifyou lee from your fire full of fear, you scorch your fellow men, 
and the burning torment of your greed cannot die out, so long as 
you do not desire yourself 

7. The mouth utters the word, the sign, and the symbol. If the 
word is a sign, it means nothing, But if the word is a symbol, it 
means everything When the way enters death and we are 
surrounded by rot and horror, the way rises in the darkness and 
leaves the mouth as the saving symbol, the word. It leads the sun 
on high, for in the symbol there is the release of the bound human 


252 In BlackBook 4, chis is spoken by his soul. In this chapter and in Sersini, we find a shift in the atribution of some statements i the Black Boas from the soul tothe 
other characters, This textual revision marks an important psychological process of differentiating the characters, separating them out from one another, and disiden- 
‘fying from them. Jung discussed this proces in general in 1928, in The Relsons between the I and the Unconscious, ch 7, “The technique for differentiation between the 1 
and the figures of the unconscious" (CW 7). In Black Bock 6, che soul explains to Jung in 1916:“If Tam nor conjoined hough the uniting of the Below and the Above, 
{rea down into theee parts: the serpent, 2nd in that or some other animal frm I roam. living natare daimonically arousing fear and longing, The lamar soa, ving 
forever within you. The celestial sul, as uch dwelling with the Gods, fr from you and unknown to you, appearing inthe form ofa bird” (Appendix C, p 370). The 
‘extual changes that Jung makes among the soul, the spent, and the bied from the Black Books inthis chapter and in Scrutiny can be scen t be the recognition and. 
dliffeentiation of the threefold nature ofthe soul. Jungs notion of the unity and multiplicity of the soul resembles Eckhart’ In Sermon 52, Eckhart wrote: the soul 
wich her higher powers touches eternity, which is God. while her lower powers being in touch with time make her subject to change and biased toward bodily things, 
Svhich degrade her" (Semon Treaties vol. te M, C°C, Wale (London: Watkins, 1981), p59) In Sermon 85 he wrote “Three tings prevent the soul from uniting 
‘vith God The fse is char ake is too seattered, and that she is not unitary: for when the soul is inclined toward eeatutes, she is aot unitary The second is when she is 
involved with temporal things. The thied is when she is turned toward the body for then she cannot unite with Ged” (bid, p. 264) 

253 The Draft continues." “Why. you ask, does man not want to eeach himsel The raging prophet who preceded this time wrote a book about this and embellished ie

force struggling with darkness. Our freedom does not lie outside 
us, but within us. One can be bound outside, and yet one will still 
feel free since one has burst inner bonds. One can certainly gain 
outer freedom through powerful actions, but one creates inner 
freedom only through the symbol. 

8. The symbol is the word that goes out of the mouth, that one 
does not simply speak, but that rises out of the depths of the self 
as a word of power and great need and places itself unexpect- 
edly on the tongue. It is an astonishing and perhaps seemingly 
irrational word, but one recognizes it as a symbol since it is alien 
to the conscious mind. If one accepts the symbol, it is as if a door 
opens leading into a new room whose existence one previously 
did not know. Butif one does not accept the symbol, it is as if one 
carelessly went past this door; and since this was the only door 
leading to the inner chambers, one must pass outside into the 
streets again, exposed to everything external, But the soul suffers 
great need, since outer freedom is of no use to it. Salvation is a 
Jong road that leads through many gates. These gates are symbols. 
Each new gate is at first invisible; indeed, it seems at first that / 
it must be created, for it exists only if one has dug up the spring’s 
root, the symbol. 

To find the mandrake, one needs the black dog. since good 
and bad must always be united firs if the symbol is to be created. 
The symbol can be neither thought up nor found: it becomes. 
Its becoming is like the becoming of human life in the womb. 
Pregnancy comes about through voluntary copulation. It goes on 
through willing attention, But if the depths have conceived, then 
the symbol grows out of itself and is born from the mind, as befits 
4 God, But in the same way a mother would like to throw herself 
on the child like a monster and devour it again. 

In the morning, when the new sun rises, the word steps out of, 
my mouth, but is murdered lovelessly, since I did not know that 
it was the savior. The newborn child grows quickly, if I accept 
it. And immediately it becomes my charioteer. The word is the 
guide, the middle way which easily oscillates like the needle on 
the scales. The word is the God that rises out of the waters each 
morning and proclaims the guiding law to the people. Outer laws 
and outer wisdom are eternally insufficient, since there is only 
one law and one wisdom, namely my daily law, my daily wisdom, 
The God renews himself each night. 

The God appears in multiple guises; for when he emerges, he 
has assumed some of the character of the night and the nightly 
waters in which he slumbered, and in which he struggled for 
renewal in the last hour of the night. Consequently his appear- 
ance is twofold and ambiguous; indeed, it even tears at the heart 
and the mind, On emerging, the God calls me toward the right 
and the left, his voice calling out to me from both sides. Yet the 
God wants neither the one nor the other. He wants the middle 
way. But the middle is the beginning of the long road, 

Man, however, can never see this beginning; he always sees 
only one and not the other, or the other and not the one, but 


‘THE WAY OF THE CROSS | 311 


never that which the one as well as the other encloses in itself 
The point of origin is where the mind and the will stand still; it 
is a state of suspension that evokes my outrage, my defiance and 
eventually my greatest fear. For I can see nothing anymore and 
can no longer want anything. Or at least that is how it seems to 
me. The way is 2 highly peculiar standstill of everything that was 
previously movement, it is a blind waiting, a doubtful listening 
and groping, One is convinced that one will burst. But the reso- 
lution is born from precisely this tension, and it almost always 
appears where one did not expect it 

But what is the resolution? It is always something ancient and 
precisely because of this something new, for when something long 
since passed away comes back again in a changed world, itis new, 
‘To give birth to the ancient in anew time is creation. This is the 
creation ofthe new, and that redeems me. Salvation is the resolution 
of the task. The task is to give birth to the old in a new time. The 
soul of humanity is like the great wheel of the zodiac that rolls 
along the way. Everything that comes up in a constant movement 
from below to the heights was already there. There is no part of 
the wheel that does not come around again. Hence everything 
that has been streams upward there, and what has been will be 
again, For these are all things which are the inborn properties of 
human nature, It belongs to the essence of forward movement 
that what was returns.“ Only the ignorant can marvel at this. Yet 
the meaning does not lie in the eternal recurrence of the same, 
but in the manner of its recurring creation at any given time. 

The meaning lies in the manner and the direction of the 
recurring creation. But how do I create my charioteer? Or do I 
want to be my own charioteer? I can guide myself only with will 
and intention, But will and intention are simply part of myself 
Consequently they are insufficient to express my wholeness. 
Intention is what I can foresee, and willing is to want a foreseen 
goal. But where do I find the goal? I take it from what is presently 
known to me. Thus I set the present in place of the future. In this 
/ manner, though I cannot reach the future, I artificially produce 
a constant present. Everything that would like to break into this 
present strikes me as a disturbance, and I seek to drive it away so 
that my intention survives. Thus I close off the progress of life. 
But how can I be my own charioteer without will and intention? 
‘Therefore a wise man does not want to be a charioteer, for he 
knows that will and intention certainly attain goals but disturb 
the becoming of the future. 

Futurity grows out of me; I do not create it, and yet I do, 
though not deliberately and willfully, but rather against will 
and intention, If I want to create the future, then I work against 
my future, And if I do not want to create it, once again I do not 
take sufficient part in the creation of the future, and everything 
happens then according to unavoidable laws to which I fall victim. 
‘The ancients devised magic to compel fate. They needed it to 
determine outer fate. We need it to determine inner fate and 
to find the way that we are unable to conceive. For along time I

The Magician” 


Cap. xxi 


(HI: 139] {x} [1] After a long search I found the small house 
in the country fronted by a large bed of tulips. This is where 
IAHMAN [Philemon], the magician, lives with his wife, BAYKIE 
[Baucis]. OIAHMON is one of those magicians who has not yet 
managed to banish old age, but who lives it with dignity, and his 
wife can only do the same. Their interests seem to have become 
narrow, even childish. They water their bed of tulips and tell each 
other about the flowers that have newly appeared. And their 
days fade into a pale wavering chiaracuso, lit up by the past, only. 
slightly frightened of the darkness of what is to come. 

‘Why is ®IAHMON a magician? Does he conjure up 
immortality for himself, a life beyond? He was probably only 
a magician by profession, and he now appears to be a pensioned 
magician who has retired from service. His desirousness and 
creative drive have expired and he now enjoys his well-earned 
rest out of sheer incapacity, like every old man who can do nothing 
else than plant tulips and water his little garden, The magical 
rod lies in a cupboard together with the sixth and seventh books 
of Moses" and the wisdom of EPMHE TPIEMETIETYE [Hermes 
Trismegitsus]°° @IAHMQN js old and has become somewhat 
feeble-minded. He still murmurs a few magical spells for the well- 
being of bewitched cattle in return for some petty cash or a gift 
for the kitchen, But it is uncertain if these spells are still correct 
and whether he understands their meaning, It is also clear that 
it hardly matters what he murmurs, / as the cattle might also 
get well on their own. There goes old GIAHMON in the garden, 
bent, with a watering can in his shaking hand. Baucis stands at 
the kitchen window and looks at him calmly and impassively. She 
haas already seen this image a thousand times—somewhat more 
infirm every time, feebler, seeing it a little less well every time 
since her eyesight gradually has become weaker:

I stand at the garden gate. They have not noticed the stranger, 
“@IAHMON, old magician, how are you?" I call out to him. He 
does not hear me, seeming to be stone-deaf I follow him and take 
his arm, He turns and greets me awkwardly and trembling, He has 
a white beard and thin white hair and a wrinkled face and there 
appears to be something about this face. His eyes are gray and old 
and something in them is strange, one would like to say alive. “I 
am well, strangers.” he says, “but what are you doing here?” 

I; “People tell me that you understand the black art. I am

bygone practice, And then I came to you because I heard that 
you understand the black art. If magic were still taught today 
at university, I would have studied it there. But the last college of 
magic was closed long ago. Today no professor knows anything 
anymore about magic. So do not be sensitive and miserly, but 
tell me a bit about your art, Surely, you don’t want to take your 
secrets with you to the grave, do you?”

I leave the small garden and walk down the street. People are 
standing around in groups and glancing at me furtively. I hear them 
whispering behind my back: “Look, there he goes, old 1AHMON's 
student. He spoke a long time with the old man, He has learned 
something, He knows the mysteries. Ifonly I could do what he is 
able to do now” *Be quiet, you damned fools,” I want to call out 
to them, but I cannot, since I do not know whether I have actually 
learned anything. And because I remain silent, they are even more 
convinced that I have received the black art from @IAHMON.” 


*9[2] [HI 142] Irs an error to believe that there are magical practices 
that one can learn, One cannot understand magic. One can only 
understand what accords with reason. Magic accords with 
unreason, which one cannot understand. The world accords not 
only with reason but also with unreason. But just as one employs 
reason to make sense of the world, in that what is reasonable 
about it approaches reason, a lack of understanding also accords 
with unreason, / 

‘This meeting is magical and eludes comprehension, Magical 
understanding is what one calls noncomprehension. Everything that 
‘works magically is incomprehensible, and the incomprehensible 
often works magically. One calls incomprehensible workings 
magical. The magical always surrounds me, always involves me 
It opens spaces that have no doors and leads out into the open 
where there is no exit, The magical is good and evil and neither 
good nor evil, Magic is dangerous since what accords with unreason 
confuses, allures and provokes; and I am always its first victim. 

Where reason abides, one needs no magic. Hence our time 
no longer needs magic. Only those without reason needed it 
to replace their lack of reason. But it is thoroughly unreasonable 
to bring together what suits reason with magic since they have 
nothing to do with one another. Both become spoiled through 
being brought together. Therefore all those kicking reason quite 
rightly fall into superfluity and disregard. A rational man of this 
time will therefore never use magic.” 

But it is another thing for whoever has opened the chaos 
in himself. We need magic to be able to receive or invoke the 
messenger and the communication of the incomprehensible. 
We recognized that the world comprises reason and unreason; 
and we also understood that our way needs not only reason but 
also unreason. This distinction is arbitrary and depends upon 
the level of comprehension. But one can be certain that the 


greater part of the world eludes our understanding. We must 
value the incomprehensible and unreasonable equally, although 
they are not necessarily equal in themselves; a part of the incom- 
prehensible, however, is only presently incomprehensible and 
might already concur with reason tomorrow. But as long as one 
does not understand it, it remains unreasonable, Insofar as the 
incomprehensible accords with reason, one may try to think 
it with success; but insofar as it is unreasonable, / one needs 
magical practices to open it up. 

‘The practice of magic consists in making what is not understood 
understandable in an incomprehensible manner. The magical 
way is not arbitrary, since that would be understandable, but 
it arises from incomprehensible grounds. Besides, to speak of 
grounds is incorrect, since grounds concur with reason. Nor can 
one speak of the groundless, since hardly anything further can be 
said about this. The magical way arises by itself, If one opens up 
chaos, magic also arises. 

One can teach the way that leads to chaos, but one cannot 
teach magic, One can only remain silent about this, which seems 
to be the best apprenticeship. This view is confusing, but this is 
what magic is like. Where reason establishes order and clarity, 
magic causes disarray and a lack of clarity.” One indeed needs 
reason for the magical translation of the not-understood into 
the understandable, since only by means of reason can the 
understandable be created, No one can say how to use reason, 
but it does arise if one tries to express only what an opening of 
chaos means.” 

Magic is a way of living, Ifone has done one’s best to steer the 
chariot, and one then notices that a greater other is actually steer- 
ing it, then magical operation takes place. One cannot say what 
the effect of magic will be, since no one can know it in advance 
because the magical is the lawless, which occurs without rules 
and by chance, so to speak. But the condition is that one totally 
accepts it and does not reject it, in order to transfer everything 
to the growth of the tree. Stupidity too is part of this, which 
everyone has a great deal of, and also tastelessness, which is possibly 
the greatest nuisance. 

‘Thus a certain solitude and isolation are inescapable conditions 
ofife for the well-being of oneself and of the other, otherwise one 
cannot / sufficiently be oneself A certain slowness of life, which is 
like a standstill, will be unavoidable. The uncertainty of such a life 
will most probably be its greatest burden, but still I must unite 
the two conflicting powers of my soul and keep them together 
in a true marriage until the end of my life, since the magician is 
called OIAHMON and his wife BAYKIE, I hold together what 
Christ has kept apart in himself and through his example in 
others, since the more the one half of my being strives toward the 
good, the more the other half journeys to Hell. 

‘When the month of the Twins had ended, the men said to 
their shadows: “You are I,” since they had previously had their 
spirit around them as a second person. Thus the two became one, 
and through this collision the formidable broke out, precisely 
that spring of consciousness that one calls culture and which 
lasted until the time of Christ” But the fish indicated the 
moment when what was united split, according to the eternal law

of contrasts, into an underworld and upperworld. If the power 
of growth begins to cease, then the united falls into its opposites. 
Christ sent what is beneath to Hell, since it strives toward the 
‘good. That had to be. But the separated cannot remain separated 
forever: Ie will be united again and the month of the fish will soon 
be over.” We suspect and understand that growth needs both, 
and hence we keep good and evil close together. Because we know 
that too far into the good means the same as too far into evil, we 
keep them both together." 

But we thus lose direction and things no longer flow from the 
mountain to the valley, but grow quietly from the valley to the 
mountain, That which we can no longer prevent or hide is our 
fruit. The flowing stream becomes a lake and an ocean / that has 
no outlet, unless its water rises to the sky as steam and falls from 
the clouds as rain. While the sea is a death, it is also the place of 
rising, Such is @IAHMON, who tends his garden. Our hands have 
been tied, and each must sit quietly in his place. He rises invisibly 
and falls as rain on distant lands The water on the ground is no 
cloud, which should rain. Only pregnant women can give birth, 
nor those who have yet t0 conceive.” 


[HI 146] But what mystery are you intimating to me with your 
name, Oh OIAHMON? Truly you are the lover who once took in 
the Gods as they wandered the earth when everyone else refused 
them lodging, You are the one who unsuspectingly gave hospitality 
to the Gods; they thanked you by transforming your house into 
a golden temple, while the flood swallowed everyone else, You 
remained alive when chaos erupted. You it was who served in the 
sanctuary when the peoples called out in vain to the Gods, Truly, 
it is the lover who survives. Why did we not see that? And just 
when did the Gods manifest? Precisely when BAYKIE wished to 
serve the esteemed guests her only goose, that blessed stupidity: 
the animal fled to the Gods who then revealed themselves to their 
poor hosts, who had given their last. Thus I saw that the lover 
survives, and that he is the one who unwittingly grants hospitality 
to the Gods." 

Truly, Oh @1AHMON, I did not see that your hut is a temple, 
and that you, @IAHMON, and BAYKIE, serve in the sanctuary. / 
This magical power allows itself to be neither taught nor learned. 
Either one has itor does not have it. Now I know your final mystery 
you are a lover. You have succeeded in uniting what has been 
sundered, that is, binding together the Above and Below. Have we 
not known this for a long time? Yes, we knew it, no, we did not 
know it. It has always been this way, and yet it has never been 
thus, Why did I have to wander such long roads before I came 
to @IAHMON, if he was going to teach me what has been common 
knowledge for ages? Alas, we have known everything since time 


THE MAGICIAN | 315 


immemorial and yet we will never know it until it is has been 
accomplished. Who exhausts the mystery of love? 

[HI 147] Under which mask, Oh @IAHMON, are you hiding? You 
did not strike me as a lover. But my eyes were opened, and I saw 
that you are a lover of your soul, who anxiously and jealously 
guards its treasure, There are those who love men, and those who 
love the souls of men, and those who love their own soul. Such a 
cone is OIAHMON, the host of the Gods. 

You lie in the sun, Oh D1AHMON, like a serpent that coils around 
itself. Your wisdom is the wisdom of serpents, cold, with a grain 
of poison, yet healing in small doses. Your magic paralyzes and 
therefore makes strong people, who tear themselves away from 
themselves. But do they love you, are they thankful, lover of 
your own soul? Or do they curse you for your magical serpent 
poison? They keep their distance, shaking their heads and 
whispering together. 

Are you still a man, @IAHMON, or / is one not a man until 
one is a lover of one’s own soul? You are hospitable, OAHMON, 
you took the dirty wanderers unsuspectingly into your hut 
Your house then became a golden temple, and did I really leave 
your table unsatisfied? What did you give me? Did you invite 
me for a meal? You shimmered multicolored and inextricable; 
nowhere did you give yourself to me as prey. You escaped my 
grasp. I found you nowhere. Are you still a man? Your kind is 
far more serpentlike 

1 sought to grab hold of you and tear it out of you, since the 
Christians have learned to devour their God. And how long will 
it take for what happens to the God also to happen to man? I look 
into the vast land and hear nothing but wailing and see nothing 
but men consuming each other. 

Oh @IAHMON, you are no Christian, You did not let yourself 
be engorged and did not engorge me. Because of this you have 
neither lecture halls nor columned halls teeming with students 
who stand around and speak of the master and soak up his words 
like the elixir of life. You are no Christian and no pagan, but a 
hospitable inhospitable one, a host of the Gods, a survivor, an 
eternal one, the father of all eternal wisdom. 

But did I really leave you unsatisfied? No, I left you because 
1 was really satisfied. Yet what did I eat? Your words gave me 
nothing. Your words left me to myself and my doubt. And so 
I ate myself, And because of this, Oh ®IAHMAN, you are no 
Christian, since you nourish yourself from yourself and force 
men to do the same. This displeases them most, since nothing 
disgusts the human animal more than itself Because of this 
they would rather eat all crawling, hopping, swimming and 
flying creatures, yes, even their own species, before they nibble 
at themselves. But this nourishment is effective and one is soon

satiated from it. Because of this, Oh @IAHMON, we rise satiated 
from your table. 

Your way, Oh @IAHMAN, is instructive, You leave me in a 
salutary darkness, where there is nothing for me to either see 
or look for. You are no light that shines in the darkness,” no 
savior who establishes an eternal truth and thus extinguishes the 
/ nocturnal light of human understanding. You leave room for 
the stupidity and jokes of others. You do not want, Oh blessed 
one, anything from the other, but instead you tend the flowers 
in your own garden. He who needs you asks you, and, Oh clever 
IAHMON, I suppose that you also ask those from whom you 
need something and that you pay for what you receive, Christ 
hhas made men desirous, for ever since they expect gifts from 
their saviors without any service in return. Giving is as childish 
as power. He who gives presumes himself powerful. The vireue 
of giving is the sky-blue mantle of the tyrant, You are wise, Oh 
®IAHMON, you do not give. You want your garden to bloom, 
and for everything to grow from within itself 

1 praise, Oh @IAHMON, your lack of acting like a savior; you are 
no shepherd who runs after stray sheep, since you believe in the 
dignity of man, who is not necessarily a sheep. But if he happens to 
bbe a sheep, you would leave him the rights and dignity of sheep, 
since why should sheep be made into men? There are still more 
than enough men. 

You know, Oh @IAHMON, the wisdom of things to come; 
therefore you are old, oh so very ancient, and just as you tower 
above me in years, so you tower above the present in futurity, and 
the length of your past is immeasurable. You are legendary and 
unreachable, You were and will be, returning periodically. Your 
wisdom is invisible, your truth is unknowable, entirely untrue in 
any given age, and yet true in all eternity, but you pour out living 
water, from which the fowers of your garden bloom, a starry 
water, a dew of the night 

What do you need, Oh @1AHMAN? You need men for the sake 
of small things, since everything greater and the greatest thing is 
in you. Christ spoiled men, since he taught them that they can be 
saved only by one, namely Him, the Son of God, and ever since 
men have been demanding the greater things from others, 
‘especially their salvation; and if a sheep gets lost / somewhere, 
it accuses the shepherd. Oh @IAHMON, you are a man, and you 
prove that men are not sheep, since you look after the greatest 
in yourself, and hence fructifying water flows into your garden 
from inexhaustible jugs 


[HI 150] Are you lonely, Oh @IAHMON, I see no entourage and no 
companions around you; BAYKIE is only your other half. You 
live with flowers, trees, and birds, but not with men. Should you 
not live with men? Are you still a man? Do you want nothing 
from men? Do you not see how they stand together and concoct 
rumors and childish fairy tales about you? Do you not want to go 
to them and say that you are a man and a mortal as they are, and 
that you want to love them? Oh ®1AHMON, you laugh? I understand 
you. Just now I ran into your garden and wanted to tear out of 
you what I had to understand from within myself 

‘Oh @IAHMON, I understand: immediately I made you into a 
savior who lets himself be consumed and bound with gifts. That's 
what men are like, you think; they are all still Christians. But they 
‘want even more: they want you as you are, otherwise you would 
not be @1AHMON to them and they would be inconsolable, if they 


could find no bearer for their legends. Hence they would also 
laugh, if you approached them and said you were as mortal as 
they are and want to love them. If you did that, you would not be 
GIAHMON. They want you, ®1AHMAN, but not another mortal 
who suffers from the same ills as they do. 

I understand you, Oh @1AHMON, you are a true / lover, since 
you love your soul for the sake of men, because they need a king 
who lives from himself and owes no one gratitude for his life 
They want to have you thus. You fulfil the wish of the people and 
you vanish. You are a vessel of fables. You would besmirch yourself 
if you went to men as a man, since they would all laugh and call 
you a liar and a swindler, since ®IAHMON is not a man 

1 saw, Oh @IAHMAN, that crease in your face: you were young. 
once and wanted to be a man among men. But the Christian 
animals did not love your pagan humanity, since they felt in you 
what they needed. They always sought the branded one, and 
when they caught him somewhere in freedom, they locked him 
in a golden cage and took from him the force of his masculinity, 
so that he was paralyzed and satin silence, Then they praise him 
and devise fables about him. I know, they call this veneration. 
‘And if they do not find the true one, they at least have a Pope, 
‘whose occupation it is to represent the divine comedy. But the 
true one always disowns himself, since he knows nothing higher 
than to be a man. 

‘Are you laughing, Oh @IAHMON? I understand you: it irked 
you to be a man like others, And because you truly loved being 
human, you voluntarily locked it away so that you could be for men 
at least what they wanted to have from you. Therefore I see you, 
‘Oh GIAHMON, not with men, but wholly with flowers, the trees 
and the birds and all waters flowing and still thar do not besmirch 
your humanity. For you are not @IAHMON to the flowers, trees, and 
birds, but aman. Yet what solitude, what inhumanity! / 


[HI 152] Why are you laughing, Oh DIAHMON, I connot fthom you, But 
oI not see the blue air of your garden? What happy shades surround you? 
Does the sun hatch blue midday specters around you? 

‘Are you laughing, Oh @IAHMAN? Alas, I understand you: 
humanity has completely faded for you, but its shadow has arisen 
for you. How much greater and happier the shadow of humanity 
is than itis itself The blue midday shadows of the dead! Alas, there 
is your humanity, Oh @1AHMAN, you are a teacher and friend of 
the dead. They stand sighing in the shade of your house, they live 
under the branches of your tres. They drink the dew of your tears, 
they warm themselves at the goodness of your heart, they hunger 
after the words of your wisdom, which sounds full to them, full 
of the sounds of life. I saw you, Oh @IAHMON, at the noonday hour 
when the sun stood highest; you stood speaking with a blue shade, 
blood stuck to its forehead and solemn torment darkened it. I can 
‘guess, Oh @IAHMON, who your midday guest was. How blind I 
‘was, fool that I am! That is you, Oh ®IAHMON! But who am I! I go 
my way, shaking my head, and people’s looks follow me and I remain 
silent. Oh despairing silence! / [HI 153]

mouth of the Gods remains silent, then each can listen to his 
own speech. He who loves the people remains silent. If only false 
teachers teach, the people will kill the false teachers, and will fall 
into the truth even on the way of their sins. Only after the 
darkest night will it be day. So cover the lights and remain silent 
so that the night will become dark and noiseless. The sun rises 
without our help. Only he who knows the darkest error knows

I continue on my way, accompanied by a finely polished piece 
of steel, hardened in ten fires, stowed safely in my robe. Secretly, 
I wear chain mail under my coat. Overnight I became fond of 
serpents, and I solved their riddle. I sit down next to them on 
the hot stones lying by the wayside. I know how to catch them 
cunningly and cruelly, those cold devils that prick the heel of the 
unsuspecting. I became their friend and played a softly toned 
flute, But I decorate my cave with their dazzling skins. As I 
walked on my way, I came to a red rock on which a great irides- 
cent serpent lay. Since I had now learned magic from ®IAHMQN, 
I took out my flute again and played a sweet magical song to 
make her believe that she was my soul. When she was sufficiently 
enchanted, / [Image 155} {2} [1] I spoke to her: "My sister, 
my soul, what do you say?* But she spoke, flattered and therefore 
tolerantly: “I let grass grow over everything that you do” 

I: “That sounds comforting and seems not to say much.” 

S: “Would you like me to say much? I can also be banal, as 
you know, and let myself be satisfied that way” 

I: “That seems hard to me. I believe that you stand in a close 
connection with everything beyond, /* with what is greatest 
and most uncommon. Therefore I thought that banality would 
be foreign to you.” 

S: “Banality is my element.” 

I: “That would be less astonishing if I said it about myself” 

S:"The more uncommon you are, the more common I can be. 
A true respite for me. I think you can sense that I don't need to 
torment myself today” 


‘THE MAGICIAN | 317 


I: “Lcan feel it, and I’m worried that your tree will ultimately 
bear me no more fruit.” 

S: "Worried already? Don’t be stupid, and let me rest.” 

I:"I notice that you like being banal, But I do not take you to 
heart, my dear friend, since I now know you much better than 
before.” 

S: "You're getting to be familiar. I'm afraid that you are 
beginning to lose respect.” 

I: “Are you upset? I believe that would be uncalled for. 
I'm sufficiently well-informed about the proximity of pathos 
and banality” 

S: "So, have you noticed that the becoming of the soul follows 
a serpentine path? Have you seen how soon day becomes night, 
and night day? How water and dry land change places? And 
that everything spasmodic is merely destructive?” 

I: “I believe that I saw all this, I want to lie in the sun on this 
warm stone for awhile, Perhaps the sun will incubate me.” 


But the serpent crept up to me quietly and wound herself 
smoothly around my feet Evening fell and night came. I spoke 
to the serpent and said: “I don't know what to say. All pots are 
on the boil.” 

™S:"A meal is being prepared.” 

I:“A Last Supper, I suppose?” 

S:"A union with all humanity” 

1: ‘A horrifying, sweet thought: to be both guest and dish at 
this meal.”™* 

$: “That was also Christ’s highest pleasure.” 

I: “How holy, how sinful, how everything hot and cold flows 
into one another! Madness and reason want to be married, 
the lamb and the wolE graze peacefully side by side It is all yes 
and no. The opposites embrace each other, see eye to eye, and 
intermingle. They recognize their oneness in agonizing pleasure. 
My heart is filled with wild battle, The waves of dark and bright 
rivers rush together, one crashing over the other. I have never 
experienced this before.” 

S: “That is new, my dear one, at least for you.” 

I; “I suppose you are mocking me. But tears and laughter are 
one. / I no longer feel like either and I am rigid with tension, 
Loving reaches up to Heaven and resisting reaches just as high

They are entwined and will not let go of each other, since the 
excessive tension seems to indicate the ultimate and highest 
possibility of feeling.” 

S: "You express yourself emotionally and philosophically. You 
know that one can say all this much more simply: For example, 
one can say that you have fallen in love all the way from the 
‘worm up to Tristan and Isolde.” 

1: “Yes, I know, but nonetheless—" 

S: “Religion is still tormenting you, it seems? How many 
shields do you still need? Much better to say it straight out.” 

I.” You're not tripping me up.” 

S:*Well, what is it with morality? Have morality and immorality 
also become one today?” 

1: “You're mocking me, my sister and chthonic devil. But I 
‘must say that those two that rose up to Heaven entwined are also 
‘good and evil, I'm not joking but I groan, because joy and pain 
sound shrill together” 

S: "Where then is your understanding? You've gone utterly 
stupid. Afterall, you could resolve everything by thinking” 

I: “My understanding? My thinking? I no longer have any 
understanding, It has grown impervious to me.” 

S: *You deny everything that you believed. You've completely 
forgotten who you are. You even deny Faust, who walked calmly 
past all the specters.” 

I: “I'm no longer up to this. My spirit, too, is a specter.” 

S:*Ah, I see, you follow my teaching” 

I: “Unfortunately, that’s the case, and it has benefited me with 
painful joy” 

S: “You turn your pain into pleasure. You are twisted, blinded; 
just suffer, you fool.” 

I: “This misfortune ought to make me happy.” 


“The serpent now became angry and tried to bite my heart, but my 
seeret armor broke her poisonous fang™ She drew back astonished 
and said hissing “You actually behave as if you were unfathomable.” 

I: “That's because I have studied the art of stepping from the 
left foot onto the right and vice versa, which others have done 
unthinkingly from time immemorial.” 

The serpent raised herself again, as if accidentally / holding 
her tail in front of her mouth, so that I should not see the broken 
fang. Proudly and calmly she said “So you have finally noticed

this?” But I spoke to her smilingly: “The sinuous line of life could 
not escape me in the long run.” 


[2] [HI 158] Where is truth and faith? Where is warm trust? 
‘You find all this between men but not between men and serpents, 
even if they are serpent souls. But wherever there is love, the 
serpentlike abides also. Christ himself compared himself to a 
serpent,” and his hellish brother, the Antichrist, is the old 
dragon himself* What is beyond the human that appears in 
love has the nature of the serpent and the bird, and the serpent 
often enchants the bird, and more rarely the bird bears off the 
serpent, Man stands in-between, What seems like a bird to you 
a serpent to the other, and what seems like a serpent to you 
a bird to the other. Therefore you will meet the other only in 
human form, If you want to become, then a battle between bird 
and serpent breaks out. And if you only want to be, you will be a 
man to yourself and to others, He who is becoming belongs in the 
desert or in a prison, for he is beyond the human. If men want to 
become, they behave like animals. No one saves us from the evil 
of becoming, unless we choose to go through Hell. 

Why did I behave as if that serpent were my soul? Only, it 
seems, because my soul was a serpent. This knowledge gave my 
soul a new face, and I decided henceforth to enchant her myself 
and subject her to my power. Serpents are wise, and I wanted my 
serpent soul to communicate her wisdom to me. Never before 
had life been so doubtful, a night of aimless tension, being one 
in being directed against one another. Nothing moved, neither 
God nor the devil. So I approached the serpent that lay in the 
sun, as if she were unthinking, Her eyes were not visible, since 
they blinked in the shimmering sunshine, and / [Image 159]™* / 
{8} Li] I spoke to her”: “How will it be, now that God and the 
devil have become one? Are they in agreement to bring life to a 
standstill? Does the confit of opposites belong to the inescapable 
conditions of life? And does he who recognizes and lives the unity 
of opposites stand stil? He has completely taken the side of actual 
life, and he no longer acts as if he belonged to one party and had 
to battle against the other, but he is both and has brought their 
discord to an end. Through taking this burden from life, has 
he also taken the force from it?" 

The serpent turned and spoke ill-humoredly: “Truly, you pester 


me. Opposites were certainly an element of life for me. You

of this source of power. I can neither lure you with pathos nor

1: “If you are baffled, should I give counsel? I would rather 
you dive down to the deeper grounds to which you have entry 
and ask Hades or the heavenly ones, perhaps someone there can 
give counsel.” 

S: “You have become imperious.”

able to move.” 

S: "You have the whole wide earth. What do you want to ask 
the beyond for?” 

1: “Te isn't curiosity that drives me, but necessity. I will not yield.” 

S: Tobey, but reluctantly. This style is new and unaccustomed 
to me.” 

1: “I'm sorry, but there is pressing need, Tell the depths that 
prospects are not looking too good for us, because we have cut 
off an important organ from life. As you know, I’m not the guilty 
‘one, since you have led me carefully along this way”

do, I am serious. We need some air. Be on your way and fetch the 
fire. Ie has already been dark around me for too long, Are you 
sluggish or cowardly?” 

S: “I'm off to work. Take from me what I bring up."** 


[HI 160] Slowly, the throne of the God ascends into empty

Satan himself. He resists and clings to his beyond. He will not /

I: "Welcome, hot thing of darkness! My soul probably pulled 
you up roughly?” 

‘S="Why this noise? I protest against this violent extraction.”

seem to be. We have no single correct truth either. Rather, a most 
remarkable and strange fact has occurred: after the opposites had 
been united, quite unexpectedly and incomprehensibly nothing 
furcher happened. Everything remained in place, peacefully and yet 
completely motionless, and life turned into a complete standstill” 

S: “Yes, you fools, you certainly have made a pretty mess 
of things.” 

I. “Well, your mockery is unnecessary. Our intentions 
were serious.” 

S: "Your seriousness leads us to suffer. The ordering of the 
beyond is shaken to its foundations.” 

1: “So you realize that matters are serious. I want an answer 
to my question, what should happen under these circumstances? 
“We no longer know what to do.” 

S: “Well, it is hard to know what to do, and difficult to give 
advice even if one would like to give it. You are blinded fools, a 
brashly impertinent people, Why didn’t you stay out of trouble? 
How do you mean to understand the ordering of the world?” 

I: “Your ranting suggests that you are quite thoroughly 
aggrieved. Look, the holy trinity is taking things coolly. It seems 
not to dislike the innovation.” 

S: “Ah, the trinity is so irrational that one / can never trust 
its reactions, I strongly advise you not to take those symbols 
seriously”** 

1: "I thank you for this well-meant advice. But you seem to be 
interested, One would expect you to pass unbiased judgment on 
account of your proverbial intelligence.” 

S: “Me, unbiased! You can judge for yourself. If you consider 
this absoluteness in its completely lifeless equanimity, you can 
easily discover that the state and standstill produced by your 
presuumptuousness closely resembles the absolute. But if I counsel 
you, I place myself completely on your side, since you too find 
this standstill unbearable.” 

I: “What? You take my side? That is strange. 

S: "That's not so strange. The absolute was always adverse to 
the living. I am still the real master of life.” 

1: "That is suspicious, Your reaction is far too personal.” 

S: “My reaction is far from personal. I am utterly restless, 
quickly hucrying life. I am never contented, never unperturbed. 
I pull everything down and hastily rebuild. I am ambition, greed 
for fame, lust for action; I am the fizz of new thoughts and action, 
The absolute is boring and vegetative.” 

I: “Alright, I believe you. So—just what do you advise?” 

S: “The best advice I can give you is: revoke your completely 
harmful innovation as soon as possible.” 

1: “What would be gained by that? Weld have to start from 
scratch again and would infallibly reach the same conclusion a 
second time, What one has grasped once, one cannot intentionally 
not know again and undo, Your counsel is no counsel.” 

S: “But could you exist without divisiveness and disunity? You 
have to get worked up about something, represent a party, overcome 
opposites, if you want to live.”

We have grown tired of this game.”

I; “It seems to me that it depends on what you call life. Your 
notion of life has to do with climbing up and tearing down, 
with assertion and doubt, with impatient dragging around, / 
[Image 163] / with hasty desire. You lack the absolute and its 
forbearing patience.” 

S: “Quite right. My life bubbles and foams and stirs up 
turbulent waves, it consists of seizing and throwing away, ardent 
wishing and restlessness. That is life, isn’t it?” 

I. "But the absolute also lives.” 

S:"That is no life, It is a standstill or as good as a standstill, or 
rather: it lives interminably slowly and wastes thousands of years, 
just like the miserable condition that you have created.”

standstill is the forbearing life of eternity, the life of divinity! This

[HI 164/2] [2] Where to begin, oh Gods? In suffering or 
in joy, or in the mixed feeling lying between? The beginning is 
always the smallest, it begins in nothing, IF begin there, I see the 
little drop of “something” that falls into the sea of nothingness. 
Ie is forever about beginning again down where the nothingness 
widens itself to unrestricted freedom.”* Nothing has happened 
yet, the world has yet to begin, the sun is not yet born, the watery 
firmament has not been separated,” we have not yet climbed 
onto the shoulders of our fathers, since our fathers have not yet 
become. They have only just died and rest in the womb of our 
bloodthirsty Europe 

We stand in the vastness, wed to the serpent, and consider 
which stone could be the foundation stone of the building, / 
which we do not yet know. The most ancient? It is suitable as 
a symbol. We want something graspable. We are weary of the 
webs that the day weaves and the night unpicks. The devil is 
probably supposed to create it, that paltry partisan with sham 
understanding and greedy hands? He emerged from the lump 


of manure in which the Gods had secured thei eggs. I would like 
10 kick the garbage away from me, if the golden seed were not in 
the vile heart of the misshapen form, 

Arise then, son of darkness and stench! How firmly you cling 
to the rubble and waste of the eternal cesspit! I do not fear you, 
though I hate you, you brother of everything reprehensible in me. 
“Today, you shall be forged with heavy hammers so that the gold 
of the Gods will spray out of your body. Your time is over, your 
years are numbered, and today your day of judgment has gone to 
smithereens. May your casings burst asunder, with our hands we 
wish to take hold of your seed, the golden one, and free it from 
slithery mud. May you freeze, devil, since we will cold-forge you. 
Steel is harder than ice. You shall fit into our form, you thief of 
the divine marvel, you mother ape, you who stuff your body with 
the egg of the Gods and thereby make yourself weighty. Hence 
‘we curse you, though not because of you, but for the sake of the 
golden seed. 

What serviceable forms rise from your body, you thieving 
abyss! These appear as elemental spirits, dressed in wrinkled 
garb, Cabiri, with delightful misshapen forms, young and yet old, 
dwarfish, shriveled, unspectacular bearers of secret arts, possessors 
of ridiculous wisdom, first formations of the unformed gold, 
‘worms that crawl from the liberated egg of the Gods, incipient 
ones, unborn, still invisible, What should your appearance be to 
us? What new arts do you bear up from the inaccessible treasure 
chamber, the sun yoke from the egg of the Gods? You still have 
roots in the soil like plants and you are animal faces / of the 
human body; you are foolishly sweet, uncanny, primordial, and 
earthly. We cannot grasp your essence, you gnomes, you object- 
souls. You have your origin in the lowest. Do you want to become 
giants, you Tom Thumbs? Do you belong to the followers of the 
son of the earth? Are you the earthly feet of the Godhead? What 
do you want? Speak!”

your following?”

carry up what slumbers in the earthly, what is dead and yet enters 
into the living, We do this slowly and easily, what you do in vain 
in your human way. We complete what is impossible for you.” 

1: “What should I leave to you? Which troubles can I transfer 
to you? What should I not do, and what do you do better?” 

The Cabiri: “You forget the lethargy of matter. You want to 
pull up with your own force what can only rise slowly, ingesting 
itself, affixed to itself from within. Spare yourself the trouble, or 
you will disturb our work.” 

1: "Should I trust you, you untrustworthy ones, you slaves and 
slave souls? Get to work. Let it be 80.” 


» [HI 166] “It seems to me that I gave you along time. Neither 
did I descend to you nor did I disturb your work. I lived in the 
light of day and did the work of the day, What did you do?” 

The Cabiri: “We hauled things up, we built. We placed stone 
upon stone, Now you stand on solid ground.” 

1: “I feel the ground more solid. I stretch upward.” 

“The Cabiri: “We forged a flashing / sword for you, with which 
you can cut the knot that entangles you.” 

I: *L take the sword firmly in my hand. I lift it for the blow.” 

‘The Cabiris “We also place before you the devilish, skillfully 
towined knot that locks and seals you. Strike, only sharpness will 
cut through it.” 

L: “Let me see it, the great knot, all wound round! Truly a 
masterpiece of inscrutable nature, a wily natural tangle of roots 
grown through one another! Only Mother Nature, the blind 
weaver, could work such a tangle! A great snarled ball and a 
thousand small knots, all artfully tied, intertwined, truly, a human 
brain! Am I seeing straight? What did you do? You set my brain 
before me! Did you give me a sword so that its flashing sharpness 
slices through my brain? What were you thinking of?” 

‘The Cabiri: “The womb of nature wove the brain, the womb, 
of the earth gave the iron. So the Mother gave you both 
entanglement and severing,” 

1: “Mysterious! Do you really want to make me the executioner 
of my own brain?” 

The Cabiri “Ie befits you as the master of the lower nature. 
Man is entangled in his brain and the sword is also given to him 
to cut through the entanglement.” 

“What is the entanglement you speak of?” 

‘The Cabiri: “The entanglement is your madness, the sword is 
the overcoming of madness.”*” 

1: “You offsprings of the devil, who told you chat I am mad? 
‘You earth spirits, you roots of clay and excrement, are you not 
yourselves the root fibers of my brain? You polyp-snared rubbish, 
channels for juice knotted together, parasites upon parasites, all 
sucked up and deceived, secretly climbing up over one another 
by night, you deserve the flashing sharpness of my sword. You 
‘want to persuade me to cut through you? Are you contemplating 
self-destruction? How come nature gives birth to creatures that 
she herself wants to destroy?” 

The Cabiri: “Do not hesitate. We need destruction since we 
ourselves are the entanglement. He who wishes to conquer new

anymore. We are the thousand canals in which everything also 
flows back again into its origin.” 

I: “Should I sever my own roots? Kill my own people, whose 
king I am? Should I make my own tree wither? You really are 
the sons of the devil.” 

The Cabiri: “Strike, we are servants who want to die for 
their master.” 

I: “What will happen if I strike?” 

The Cabiri: “Then you will no longer be your brain, but will 
exist beyond your madness, Do you not see, your madness is 
your brain, the terrible entanglement and intertwining in the 
connection of the roots, in the nets of canals, the confusion of 
fibers, Being engrossed in the brain makes you wild. Strike! He 
‘who finds the way rises up over his brain. You are a Tom Thumb 
in the brain, beyond the brain you gain the form of a giant. We 
are surely sons of the devil, but did you not forge us out of the 
hot and dark? So we have something of its nature and of yours. 
‘The devil says that everything that exists is also worthy, since 
it perishes. As sons of the devil we want destruction, but as your 
creatures we want our own destruction, We want to rise up in 
you through death. We are roots that suck up from all sides 
‘Now you have everything that you need, therefore chop us up, 
tear us out.” 

I: “Will I miss you as servants? As a master I need slaves.” 

‘The Cabiri: “The master serves himself” 

I: *You ambiguous sons of the devil, these words are 
your undoing. May my sword strike you, this blow shall be 
valid forever.” 

‘The Cabiri “Woe, woe! What we feared, what we desired, has 
come to pass.”

arisen from a patchwork of human thoughts, but has been forged 
from the glowing heat of the innards; the Cabiri themselves 
carried the matter to the mountain and consecrated the building 
with their own blood as the sole keepers of the mystery of its 
genesis. I built itout of the lower and upper beyond and not from 
the surface of the world, Therefore it is new and strange and 
towers over the plains inhabited by humans. This is the solid and 
the beginning 


[HI 172] 1 have united with the serpent of the beyond. I have 
accepted everything beyond into myself. From this I have built 
my beginning. When this work was completed, I was pleased, 
and I felt curious to know what might still lie in my beyond. So I 
approached my serpent and asked her / amiably whether she 
would not like to creep over to bring me news of what was 
happening in the beyond, But the serpent was weary and said that 
she had no liking for this, 


{4} 1: “I don’t wane to force anything, but perhaps, who 
knows? We will still find out something useful.” For a while the 
serpent hesitated, then she disappeared into the depths. Soon 
I heard her voice: “I believe that I have reached Hell. There is 
a hanged man here.” A plain, ugly man with a contorted face 
stands before me, He has protruding ears and a hunchback. He 
said: “I am a poisoner who was condemned to the rope.” 

I: “What did you do?” 

He: “I poisoned my parents and my wife.” 

I: “Why did you do that?” 

He: “To honor God.” 

I: "What? To honor God? What do you mean by that?” 

He: “First of all, everything that happens is for the honor of 
God, and secondly, I had my own ideas.” 

1: “What went through your mind?” 

He: "I loved them and wanted to transport them more quickly 
from a wretched life into eternal blessedness. I gave them a 
strong, too strong a nightcap.” 

1: "And did this not lead you to find out what your own interest 
in this was?” 

He: “I was now alone and very unhappy. I wanted to live for the 
sake of my two children, for whom I foresaw a better future. I was 
in better health than my wife, so / I wanted to live.” 

I: "Did your wife agree to the murders?” 

He: “No, she certainly would have consented, but she knew 
nothing of my intentions, Unfortunately, the murder was 
discovered and I was condemned to death.” 

1: “Have you found your relatives again in the beyond?” 

He: “That's a strange and unlikely story. I suspect that I'm 
in Hell. Sometimes it seems as if my wife were here too, and 
sometimes I'm not sure, just as little as I’m sure of my own self” 

1: “What is it like? Tell me.” 

He: “From time to time, she seems to speak to me and I reply. 
But we haven't spoken about either the murder or our children 
until now. We only speak together here and there, and only 
about trivial things, small matters from our earlier daily life, but 
completely impersonal, as if we no longer had anything to do 
with each other. But the true nature of things eludes me. I see 
even less of my parents; I believe that I have yet to meet my

mother, My father was here once and said something about his 
tobacco pipe, which he had lost somewhere.” 

I; “But how do you pass your time?” 

He: “I believe that there is no time with us, so there is none to 
spend. Nothing at all happens.” 

I: “Isn't that / extremely boring?” 

He: “Boring? I've never thought about it like that, Boring? 
Perhaps, but there’s nothing interesting, In actual fact, it’s pretty 
much all the same.” 

I: “Doesn't the devil ever torment you?” 

He: “The devil? I've seen nothing of him.” 

1: "You come from the beyond and yet you have nothing to 
report? I find that hard to believe.” 

He: “When I still had a body, I often thought that surely it 
‘would be interesting to speak to one of the dead. But now the 
prospect means nothing much to me. As I said, everything here 
is impersonal and purely matter of fact, As far as I know, that’s 
what they say” 

1: "That is bleak, I assume that you are in the deepest Hell.” 

He: “I don’t care. I guess I can go now, can’t I? Farewell.” 

Suddenly he vanished. But I turned to the serpent” and said 
“What should this boring guest from the beyond mean?” 

S: "I met him over there, stumbling around restlessly like so 
many others. I chose him as the next best. He strikes me as a 
good example.” 

I: “But is the beyond so colorless?” 

S: "It seems so; there is nothing but motion, when I make 
my way over there. Everything merely surges back and forth in a 
shadowy way. There is nothing personal whatsoever.” 

1: “What is it, then, with this damned personal quality? Satan 
recently made / a strong impression on me, as if he were the 
quintessence of the personal.” 

S: "Of course he would, since he is the eternal adversary, and 
because you can never reconcile personal life with absolute life.” 

1: “Can't one unite these opposites?” 

S: “They are not opposites, but simply differences. Just as 
little as you make the day the opposite of the year or the bushel 
the opposite of the cubit.” 

I: "Thar’s enlightening, but somewhat boring” 

S: “As always, when one speaks of the beyond. It goes on 
withering away, particularly since we have balanced the opposites 
and married. I believe the dead will soon become extinct.” 


[HI 176] [2] The devil is the sum of the darkness of human 
nature, He who lives in the light strives toward being the image 
‘of God; he who lives in the dark strives toward being the image of 
the devil, Because I wanted to live in the light, the sun went out 
for me when I touched the depths. It was dark and serpentlike 
united myself with it and did not overpower it. I took my part 
of the humiliation and subjugation upon myself, in that I took 
on the nature of the serpent. 

If Thad / not become like the serpent, the devil, the quintessence 
of everything serpentlike, would have held this bit of power over 
me. This would have given the devil a grip and he would have 
forced me to make a pact with him just as he also cunningly 
deceived Faust." But I forestalled him by uniting myself with the 
serpent, just as a man unites with a woman.

So I took away from the devil the possibility of influence, 
which only ever passes through one’s own serpenthood,” which one 
commonly assigns to the devil instead of oneself. Mephistopheles 
is Satan, taken with my serpenthood. Satan himself is the 
quintessence of evil, naked and therefore without seduction, not 
even clever, but pure negation without convincing force. Thus I 
resisted his destructive influence and grasped him and fettered 
him firmly, His descendants served me and I sacrificed them 
with the sword. 

Thus I buile a firm structure. Through this I myself gained 
stability and duration and could withstand the fluctuations of the 
personal. Therefore the immortal in me is saved, Through drawing 
the darkness from my beyond over into the day, I emptied my 
beyond. Therefore the demands of the dead disappeared, as they 
were satisfied. 

/ Tam no longer threatened by the dead, since I accepted 
their demands though accepting the serpent. But through this I 
have also taken over something of the dead into my day. Yet it 
was necessary, since death is the most enduring of all things, that 
which can never be canceled out. Death gives me durability and 
solidity, So long as I wanted to satisfy only my own demands, I 
‘was personal and therefore living in the sense of the world. But 
when I recognized the demands of the dead in me and satisfied 
them, I gave up my earlier personal striving and the world had to 
take me for a dead man. For a great cold comes over whoever in 
the excess of his personal striving has recognized the demands of 
the dead and seeks to satisfy them. 

While he feels as if mysterious poison has paralyzed the living 
quality of his personal relations, the voices of the dead remain 
silent in his beyond; the threat, the fear, and the restlessness 
cease, For everything that previously lurked hungrily in him no 
Jonger lives with him in his day. His life is beautiful and rich, since 
he is himseli 

But whoever always wants only the fortune of others is ugly, 
since he / cripples himself, A murderer is one who wants to 
force others to blessedness, since he kills his own growth. A. 
fool is one who exterminates his love for the sake of love. Such 
2 one is personal to the other. His beyond is gray and impersonal. 
He forces himself upon others; therefore he is cursed into 
forcing himself upon himself in a cold nothingness. He who has 
recognized the demands of the dead has banished his ugliness to 
the beyond. He no longer greedily forces himself upon others, 
but lives alone in beauty and speaks with the dead. But there 
comes the day when the demands of the dead also are satisfied. 
If one then still perseveres in solitude, beauty fades into 
the beyond and the wasteland comes over onto this side. A 
black stage comes after the white, and Heaven and Hell are 
forever there.” 


{5}[1] [HI 179] Now that I had found the beauty in me and 
with myself, I spoke to my serpent™: “I look back as onto a work 
that has been accomplished.” 

Serpent: “Nothing is accomplished yet.” 

1:"What do you mean? Not accomplished” 

Se: “This is only the beginning” 

I: "I think you are lying.” 

Se: "Whom are you quarreling with? Do you know better?” 

I:“I know / nothing, but I'd already gotten used to the idea

that we had reached a goal, at least a temporary one, If even the 
dead are about to become extinct, what else is going to happen?” 

Se: “But then the living must first begin to live.” 

1: “This remark could certainly be deeply meaningful, but it 
seems to be nothing but a joke.” 

Se: “You are getting impertinent. I'm not joking, Life has yet 
to begin.” 

I:"What do you mean by life?” 

Se:"I say, life has yet to begin. Didn't you feel empty today? Do 
you call that life?” 

1: “What you say is true, but I try to put as good a face as I can 
on everything and to settle for things” 

Se: “That might be quite comfortable, But you really ought to 
‘make much higher demands.” 

I:"That I dread. I will certainly not assume that I could satisfy 
my own demands, but neither do I think that you are capable 
of satisfying them. However, it might be that once again 'm not 
trusting you enough. I suppose that might be so because I've drawn 
closer to you in human terms and find you so urbane.” 

Se: “That proves nothing, Just don’t assume that somehow you 
could ever grasp me and embody me.” 

1: “So, what should it be? I’m ready.” 

Se: “You are entitled to’ a reward for / what has been 
accomplished so far” 

1:"A sweet thought, that payment could be made for this.” 

Se: “I give you payment in images. Behold:” 


[Hr 181] Elijah and Salome! The cycle is completed and the 
‘gates of the mysteries have opened again, Elijah leads Salome, the 
seeing one, by the hand, She blushes and lowers her eyes while 
lovingly batting her eyelids 

E: "Here, I give you Salome, May she be yours.” 

I: "For God's sake, what should I do with Salome? I am already 
married and we are not among the Turks.” 

E: "You helpless man, how ponderous you are. Is this not a 
beautiful gift? Is her healing not your doing? Won't you accept 
her love as the well-deserved payment for your trouble?” 

I:"T seems to me a rather strange gift, more burden than joy. I 
am happy that Salome is thankful to me and loves me. I love her 
too—somewhat. Incidentally, the care I afforded her, was, literally, 
pressed out of me, rather than something I gave freely and 
intentionally. If my partly unintentional / ordeal has had such a 
good outcome, I'm already completely satisfied.” 

Salome to Elijah: “Leave him, he is a strange man. Heaven 
knows what his motives are, but he seems to be serious. I'm not 
ugly and surely I'm generally desirable.” 

Salome to me: “Why do you refuse me? I want to be your maid 
and serve you, I will sing and dance before you, fend off people 
for you, comfort you when you are sad, laugh with you when you 
are happy. I will carry all your thoughts in my heart. I will kiss the 
‘words that you speak to me. I will pick roses for you each day and 
all my thoughts will wait upon you and surround you.” 

I:"T thank you for your love. It is beautiful to hear you speak 
of love. It is music and old, far-off homesickness. Look, my tears 
are falling because of your good words. I want to kneel before 
you and kiss your hands a hundred times, because they want to 
give me love. You speak so beautifully of love. One can never 
hear enough of love being spoken.”

I: "You are like the serpent that coiled around me and pressed 
out my blood.”** / Your sweet words wind around me and I stand 
like someone crucified.” 

Sal: “Why still crucified?” 

I: “Don’t you see that unrelenting necessity has flung me onto 
the cross? It is impossibility that lames me.” 

Sal: “Don’t you want to break through necessity? Is what you 
call a necessity really one?”™ 

I: “Listen, I doubt that it is your destiny to belong to me. I do 
‘not want to intervene in your utterly singular life, since I can never 
help you to lead it to an end. And what do you gain if one day I 
must lay you aside like a worn garment?” 

Sal; “Your words are terrible. But I love you so much that I 
could also lay myself aside when your time has come.” 

1: “I know that it would be the greatest torment for me to let 
you go away: But if you can do this for me, I can also do it for you 
I would go on without lament, since I have not forgotten the 
dream where I saw my body lying on sharp needles and a bronze 
wheel rolling over my breast, crushing it. 1 must think of this 
dream whenever I think of love. Ifit must be, I am ready.” 

Sal; “I don’t want such a sacrifice. I want to bring you joy. Can, 
I not be joy to you” 

I: I don't know, perhaps, / perhaps not.” 

Sal: “So then at least try” 

I: "The attempt is the same as the act. Such attempts are costly” 

Sal; “Won't you bear the cost for my sake?” 

I: "Tm rather too weak, too exhausted after what I have suffered 
because of you, still to be able to undertake further tasks for you. 
I would be overwhelmed.” 

Sal: “If you don’t want to accept me, then surely I cannot 
accept you?” 

I “Ie’s not a matter of acceptance; if it’s about anything in 
particular, it’s about giving” 

Sal: “But I do give myself to you. Just accept me.” 

I: “As if that would settle the matter! But being entangled with 
love! Simply thinking about it is dreadful.” 

Sal; “So you really demand that I be and not be atthe same time 
That is impossible. What’s wrong with you?” 

1: "I lack the strength to hoist another fate onto my shoulders. 
Thave enough to carry.” 

Sal: “But what if I help you bear this load?” 

1: “How can you? You'd have to carry me, an untamed burden. 
Shoulda’t I have to carry it myself?” 

E: "You speak the truth, May each one carry his load, He who 
wants to burden others with his baggage is their slave.” It is not 
too difficult for anyone to lug themselves.” 

Sal; “But father, couldn't I help him bear part of his burden?” 

E: "Then he'd be your slave.” / 

Sal; “Or my master and ruler.” 

1: “That I shall not be. You should be a free being. I can bear 
neither slaves nor masters. I long for men.” 

Sal: ‘Am T not a human being?” 

I: “Be your own master and your own slave, do not belong to 
me but to yourself. Do not bear my burden, but your own. Thus 


you leave me my human freedom, a thing that’s worth more to 
me than the sight of ownership over another person.” 

Sal: “Are you sending me away?” 

1: “I'm not sending you away. You must not be far from me. 
But give to me out of your fullness, not your longing. I cannot 
satisfy your poverty just as you cannot still my longing. If your 
harvest is rich, send me some fruit from your garden. If you suf- 
fer from abundance, I will drink from the brimming horn of your 
joy. 1 know that thar will be a balm for me. I can satisfy myself 
only at the table of the satisfied, not at the empty bowls of those 
who yearn, I will not steal my payment. You possess nothing, so 
how can you give? Insofar as you give, you demand. Elijah, old 
man, listen: you have a strange gratitude, Do not give away your 
daughter, but set her / on her own feet. She would like to dance, 
to sing or play the lute before people, and she would like their 
flashing coins thrown before her feet. Salome, I thank you for 
your love, If you really love me, dance before the crowd, please 
people so that they praise your beauty and your art. And if you 
have a rich harvest, throw me one of your roses through the 
window, and if the fount of your joy overflows, dance and sing 
to me once more, I long for the joy of men, for their fullness and 
freedom and not their neediness” 

Sal: “What a hard and incomprehensible man you are.” 

E; "You have changed since I last saw you. You speak another 
language, one that sounds foreign to me.” 

I:"My dear old man, I'd like to believe that you find me changed. 
But you too seem to have changed. Where is your serpent?” 

E: “She has gone astray. I believe she was stolen. Since then 
things have been somewhat gloomy with us. Therefore I would 
have been happy if you had at least accepted my daughter” 

I: “I know where your serpent is. I have her. We fetched 
her from the underworld, She / gave me hardness, wisdom, and 
magical power. We need her in the upperworld, since otherwise 
the underworld would have had the advantage, to our detriment.” 

FE; “Away with you, accursed robber, may God punish you.” 

1: "Your curse is powerless. Whoever possesses the serpent 
cannot be touched by curses. No, be sensible, old man; whoever 
possesses wisdom is not greedy for power. Only the man who 
has power declines to use it. Do not cry, Salome, fortune is only 
‘what you yourself create and not what comes to you. Be gone, my 
unhappy friends, the night grows late. Elijah, expunge the false 
gleam of power from your wisdom, and you, Salome, for the sake 
of our love, do not forget to dance.” 


[2] When everything was completed in me, I unexpectedly 
returned to the mysteries, to that first sight of the otherworldly 
powers of the spirit and desire, Just as I had achieved pleasure 
in myself and power over myself, Salome had lost pleasure in 
herself but learned love for the other, and Elijah had lost the 
power of his wisdom but he had learned to recognize the spirit 
of the other: Salome thus lost the power of temptation and has 
7 become love, As I have won pleasure in myself, I also want 
love for myself. But that really would be too much and would 
bind me like an iron ring that would stifle me. I accepted Salome 
as pleasure, and reject her as love, But she wants to be with me. 
How, then, should I also have love for myself? Love, I believe,

dark abyss. 

{6p"[1] I hear Salome still crying. What does she want, or 
what do I still wane? It’s a damnable payment you have given to 
me, a payment that one cannot touch without sacrifice. One that 
requires even greater sacrifice once one has touched it 

Serpent “Do you mean to live without sacrifice? Life must 
cost you something, mustn't it?” 

I:"Thave, I believe, already paid. I have rejected Salome. Is that 
not sacrifice enough?” 

Se: “Too little for you. As has been said, you are allowed to 
make demands of yourself” 

I: "You mean well with your damned logic: demanding in 
sacrifice? That / isn’t what I understood. My error has obviously 
been to my own benefit. Tell me, isn’t it enough if I force my feeling 
into the background?” 

Se: "You're not forcing your feeling into the background at all; 
rather it suits you much better not to agonize further aver Salome.” 

I: “If you're speaking the truth, it’s quite bad. Is that why 
Salome is still crying?” 

Se: “Yes, it is.” 

I: “But what is to be done?” 

Se: “Oh, you want to act? One can also think.” 

1: "But what is there to think? I confess that I know nothing to 
think here. Pethaps you have advice. I have the feeling that I must 
soar over my own head, I can’t do that. What do you think?” 

Se: “I think nothing and have no advice either.” 

I: “So ask the beyond, go to Heaven or Hell, pechaps there is 
advice there.” 

Se: “I am being pulled upward.” 

Then the serpent turned into a small white bird which soared 
into the clouds where she disappeared. My gaze followed her for 
along time.” 

Bird: “Do you hear me? I'm far off now. Heaven is so far away. 
Hell is much nearer the earth. I found something for you, a 
discarded crown, It lay on a street in the immeasurable space of 
Heaven, a golden crown.” 

‘And now it already lies in®*/ my hand, a golden royal crown, 
with lettering incised within; what does it say? "Love never ends.”»" 
A gift from Heaven. But what does it mean? 

B: "Here I am, are you satisfied?” 

1; *Partially—at any rate I thank you for this meaningful gift 
But itis mysterious, and your gift makes me well-nigh suspicious” 

B; “But the gift comes from Heaven, you know.” 

I: “Irs certainly very beautiful, but you know very well what we 
have grasped of Heaven and Hell” 

B: “Don't exaggerate. After all, there is a difference between 
Heaven and Hell. I certainly believe, to judge from what I have

seen, that just as little happens in Heaven as in Hell, though 
probably in another way. Even what does not occur cannot occur 
in a particular way.” 

I: “You speak in riddles that could make one ill if one took 
them to heart. Tell me, what do you make of the crown?” 

B: “What do I make of it? Nothing. It truly speaks for itself” 

I:"You mean, through the inscription it bears?” 

“Precisely; I presume that makes sense to you?” 

I: “To some extent, I suppose. But that keeps the question 
awfully in suspense.” 

B: “Which is how itis meant to be.” 

Now the bird suddenly turned into the serpent again 

1: “You're unnerving.” 

Serpent:"“Only for him who isn’t in agreement with me 

I: "That I am certainly not, But how could one? To hang in the 
air in such a way is gruesome.” 

Se: “Is this sacrifice too difficult for you? You must also be able 
to hang if you want to solve problems, Look at Salome!” 

1, to Salome: “I see, Salome, that you are still weeping. You are 
not yet done for. I hover and curse my hovering, I am hanging 
for your sake and for mine. First I was crucified, now I'm simply 
hhanging—which is less noble, but no less agonizing Forgive me, 
for wanting to do you in; I thought of saving you as I did when I 
healed your blindness through my self-sacrifice. Perhaps I must 
be decapitated a third time for your sake, like your earlier friend 
John, who brought us the Christ of agony. Are you insatiable? Do 
you still see no way to become reasonable?” 

Sal: "My beloved, what can I do for you? I have utterly 
forsaken you.” 

1: "So why are you still crying? You know I can't bear seeing 
you in tears.” 

Sal:"I thought that you were invulnerable since you possessed 
the black serpent rod.” 

I: “The effect of the rod seems doubsful to me. But in one 
respect it does help me: at least I do not suffocate, although I 
have been strung up. The magic rod apparently helps me bear the 
hanging, surely a gruesome good deed and aid. Don't you at least 
want to cut the cord?” 

Sal: “How can I? You are hanging too high" High on the 
summit of the tree of life where I cannot reach, Can’t you help 
yourself, you knower of serpent wisdom?” 

I: “Must I go on hanging for long?” 

Sal: “Until you have devised help for yourself” 

1:"So atleast tell me what you think of the crown that the bird 
of my soul fetched for me from Heaven.” 

Sal: "What are you saying? The crown? You have the crown? 
Lucky one, what are you complaining about?” 

I: “A hanged king would like to change places with every 
blessed beggar on the country road who has not been hanged.” 

Sal (ecstatic): “The crown! You have the crown!” 

I: “Salome, take pity on me. What is it with the crown?” 

Sal (ecstatic): “The crown—you are to be crowned! What 
blessedness for me and you!”

1: “Alas, what do you want with the crown? I can’t understand 
ie and I'm suffering unspeakable torment.” 
Sal (cruelly): “Hang until you understand.” 


I remain silent and hang high above the ground on the 
swaying branch of the divine tree, for whose sake the original 
ancestors could not avoid sin. My hands are bound and I am 
completely helpless. So I hang for three days and three nights. 
From where should help come? There sits my bird, the serpent, 
which has put on her white feather dress. 

Bird; “Well fetch help from the clouds trailing above your 
head, when nothing else is of help to us.” 

1: "You wane to fetch help from the clouds? How is that possible?” 

B:“I will go and try” 

The bird swings off like a rising lark, becomes smaller and 
smaller, and finally disappears in the thick gray veil of clouds 
covering the sky. My gaze follows her longingly and I make 
out nothing more than the endless gray cloudy sky above me, 
impenetrably gray, harmoniously gray and unreadable. But the 
writing on the crown—that is legible, “Love never ends’—does 
that mean eternal hanging? I was not wrong to be suspicious when 
my bird brought the crown, the crown of eternal life, the crown of 
martyrdom—ominous things that are dangerously ambiguous 

Tam weary, weary not only of hanging but of struggling after 
the immeasurable. The mysterious crown lies far below my feet 
on the ground, winking gold. I do not hover, no, I hang, or rather 
‘worse, I am hanged between sky and earth—and do not tire of 
the state of hanging for I could indulge in it forever, but love never 
ends, Is it really true, shall love never end? If this was a blessed 
message to them, what is it for me? 

“That depends entirely on the notion,” an old raven suddenly 
said, perched on a branch not far from me, awaiting the funeral 
meal, and immersed in philosophizing 

I: “Why does it depend entirely on the notion?” 

Raven: “On your notion of love and the other.” 

1: “I know, unlucky old bird, you mean heavenly and earthly 
love. Heavenly love would be utterly beautiful, but we are men, 
and, precisely because we are men, I've set my mind on being a 
complete and full-fledged man.” 

R: “You're an ideologue.” 

I:"Dumb raven, be gone!” 

There, very close to my face, a branch moves, a black serpent 
has coiled itself around it and looks at me with the blinding pearly 
shimmer of its eyes, Is it not my serpent? 

I: “Sister, and black rod of magic, where do you come from? I 
thought that I saw you fly to Heaven as a bird and now you are 
here? Do you bring help?” 

Serpent: “I am only my own half, I'm not one, but two; I'm the 
one and the other. I am here only as the serpentlike, the magical. 
But magic is useless here. I wound myself idly around this branch 
to await further developments. You can use me in life, but not 
in hanging, In the worst case, I’m ready to lead you to Hades. I 
know the way there.” 

A black form condenses before me out of the ait, Satan 
with a scornful laugh. He calls to me: “See what comes from the 
reconciliation of opposites! Recant, and in a flash you'll be down 
on the greening earth.” 


336 Swedenborg described heavenly love a “loving uses forthe sake of uses, or goods forthe sake of goods, 


I: “I won't recant, I'm not stupid. If such is the outcome of all 
this, let it be the end.” 

Se: “Where is your inconsistency? Please remember this 
important rule of the art of life.” 

I: “The fact that I'm hanging here is inconsistency enough. I've 
lived inconsistently ad nauseam. What more do you want?” 

Se: “Perhaps inconsistency in the right place?” 

1: “Stop it! How should I know what the right and the wrong 
places are?” 

Satan: “Whoever gets on in a sovereign way with the opposites 
knows left from right.” 

I: “Be quiet, you're an interested party. If only my white bird 
came back with help; I fear I’m growing weak.” 

Se: “Don’t be stupid, weakness too is a way, magic makes good 
the error” 

Satan; “What, you've not yet once had the courage of weakness? 
‘You want to become a complete man—are men strong?” 

I:"White bird of mine, I suppose you can’t find your way back? 
Did you get up and leave because you couldn't live with me? Ah, 
Salome! There she comes. Come to me, Salome! Another night 
has passed. I didn’t hear you cry, but I hung and still hang.” 

Sal:“I haven't cried anymore, for good fortune and misfortune 
are balanced in me.” 

I: “My white bird has left and has not yet returned. I know 
nothing and understand nothing. Does this have to do with the 
crown? Speak!” 

Sal: “What should I say? Ask yourself.” 

1:"I cannot. My brain is like lead, I can only whimper for help. 
Thave no way of knowing whether everything is falling or standing 
still, My hope is with my white bird. Oh no, could it be that the 
bird means the same thing as hanging?” 

Satan: “Reconciliation of the opposites! Equal rights for 
all! Follies!” 

I: “I hear a bird chirping! Is that you? Have you come back?” 

Bird: “Ifyou love the earth, you are hanged; if you love the sky, 
you hover.” 

T:"What is earth? What is sky?” 

B: “Everything under you is the earth, everything above you is 
the sky. You fly if you strive for what is above you; you are hanged 
if you strive for what is below you.” 

I: “What is above me? What is beneath me?” 

B: “Above you is what is before and over you; beneath you is 
what comes back under you.” 

"And the crown? Solve the riddle of the crown for me!” 

B:“The crown and serpent are opposites, and are one. Did you 
not see the serpent that crowned the head of the crucified?” 

1: “What, I don’t understand you.” 

B: “What words did the crown bring you? “Love never ends’— 
that is the mystery of the crown and the serpent.” 

1: “But Salome? What should happen to Salome?” 

B: “You see, Salome is what you are. Fly, and she will grow wings.” 

The clouds part, the sky is full of the crimson sunset of the 
completed third day.”” The sun sinks into the sea, and I glide with 
it from the top of the tree toward the earth, Softly and peacefully 
night falls,

What a work you have accomplished, Cabiri! You have given 
birth to a cruel law from the chaos that cannot be revoked. It is 
understood and accepted. 


‘The completion of the secret operation approaches. What 
I saw I described in words to the best of my ability. Words are 
poor, and beauty does not attend them. Butis truth beautiful and 
beauty true?" 


‘One can speak in beautiful words about love, but about life? 
And life stands above love. But love is the inescapable mother 
of life. Life should never be forced into love, but love into life. 
May love be subject to torment, but not life. As long as love goes 
pregnant with life, it should be respected: but ifit has given birth 
to life from itself, it has turned into an empty sheath and expires

but for the sake of life. 

The word has become heavy for me, and it barely wrestles 
itself free of the soul, Bronze doors have shut. fires have burned 
‘out and sunk into ashes. Wells have been drained and where there 
‘were seas there is dry land. My tower stands in the desert. Happy

‘Not the power of the flesh, but of love, should be broken for 
the sake of life, since life stands above love. A man needs his 
mother until his life has developed. Then he separates from her. 
And so life needs love until it has developed, then it will cut loose 
from it. The separation of the child from the mother is difficult, 
but the separation of life from love is harder. Love seeks to have 
and to hold, but life wants more. 


‘The beginning of all things is love, but the being of things is 
life This distinction is terrible. Why, Oh spirit of the darkest 
depths, do you force me to say that whoever loves does not live 
and whoever lives does not love? I always get it backward! Should 
everything be turned into its opposite?** Will there be a sea where

‘You frighten me. Let me be happy in the embrace of my soul and

son of the devil, speak! Your silence is unbearable, and of awful 
stupidity. 

I won my soul, and to what did she give birth for me? You, 
monster, a son, hal—a frightful miscreant, a stammerer, a newt’s 
brain, a primordial lizard! You want to be king of the earth? You 
want to banish proud free men, bewitch beautiful women, break

lazy bug-eyed frog that wears pond weed on his skul’s pate! And 
you want to call yourself my son? You're no son of mine, but the 
spawn of the devil. The father of the devil entered into the womb 
of my soul and in you has become flesh

You have deceived me. You impregnated my maidenly soul with 
the terrible worm. @IAHMON, damned charlatan, you aped the 
mysteries for me, you lay the mantle of the stars on me, you 
played a Christ-foo!'s comedy with me, you hanged me, carefully 
and ludicrously, in the tree just like Odin, you let me devise 
runes to enchant Salome—and meanwhile you procreated my 
soul with the worm, spew of the dust. Deception upon deception! 
Terrible devil trickery! 

You gave me the force of magic, you crowned me, you clad 
me with the shimmer of power, that let me play a would-be 
Joseph father to your son. You lodged a puny basilisk in the 
nest of the dove. 

My soul, you adulterous whore, you became pregnant with this 
bastard! I am dishonored: I, laughable father of the Antichrist! 
How I mistrusted you! And how poor was my mistrust, that it 
could not gauge the magnitude of this infamous act! 

‘What do you break apart? You broke love and life in twain. 
From this ghastly sundering, the frog and the son of the frog 
come forth, Ridiculous—disgusting sight! Irresistible advent! 
They will sit on the banks of the sweet water and listen to the 
nocturnal song of the frogs, since their God has been born as a 
son of frogs. 


‘Where is Salome? Where is the unresolvable question of love?

come to pass, it has come to pass, and we will have to see how you 
can do it better in the future, Take a pound of otter lard, bury it 
in the earth, and let nine months pass. Then dig up that place 
again and sce what you find.’ So the king went to his house, 
ashamed and saddened, because he had humiliated himself 
before the witch in the forest. Yet he listened to her advice, dug 
a hole in the garden at night, and placed a pot of otter lard in 
it, which he had obtained with some difficulty. Then he let nine 
months go by. 

“After this time had passed he went again by night to the 
place where the pot lay buried and dug it up. To his great 
astonishment, he found a sleeping infant in the pot, though the lard 
had disappeared, He took out the infant and jubilantly brought it 
to his wife. She took itimmediately to her breast and behold—her 
milk flowed freely. And so the child thrived and became great and 
strong, He grew into a man who was greater and stronger than all 
others, When the king’s son was twenty years old, he came before 
his father and said: ‘I know that you have produced me through 
sorcery and that I was not born as one of men. You have made me 
from the repentance of your sins and this has made me strong. I 
am born from no woman, which makes me clever. I am strong and 
clever and therefore I demand the crown of the realm from you. 
“The old king was startled at his son’s knowledge, but even more 
by his impetuous longing for regal power. He remained silent and 
‘thought: ‘What has produced you? Otter lard. Who bore you? The 
womb of the earth, I drew you from a pot, a witch humiliated me’ 
And he decided to let his son be killed secretly. 

“But because his son was stronger than others, he feared him 
and therefore he wanted to take refuge in a trick. He went again 
to the sorceress in the forest and asked her for advice. She said: 
“Dear King, you confess no sin to me this time, because you want 
to commit a sin, I advise you to bury another pot with otter’s 
lard and leave it to lie in the earth for nine months. Then dig 
it out again and see what has happened.’ The king did what the 
sorceress advised him, And thenceforth his son became weaker 
and weaker, and when the king returned to the place where the 
pot lay after nine months, he could dig his son’s grave at the same 
time. He lay the dead one in the fosse beside the empty pot. 

“But the king was saddened, and when he could no longer 
master his melancholy, he returned yet again to the sorceress one 
night and asked her for advice. She spoke to him: ‘Dear King, you 
‘wanted a son, but the son wanted to be king himself and also had 
the power and cleverness for it, and then you wanted your son no 
more. Because of this you lost your son, Why are you complaining? 
You have everything, dear King, that you wanted.’ But the king 
said: “You are right. I wanted it so. But I did not want this 
melancholy. Do you have any remedies against remorse?” The 
sorceress spoke: ‘Dear King, go to your son’s grave, fill the pot 
again with otter’s lard, and after nine months see what you find 
in the pot’ The king did this, as he had been commanded, and 
henceforth he became happy and did not know why. 

“When the nine months had passed, he dug out the pot again; 
the body had disappeared, but in the pot there lay a sleeping 
infant, and he realized that the infant was his dead son, He 
took the infant to himself, and henceforth he grew as much in 
a week as other infants grow in a year. And when twenty weeks 
had passed, the son came before the father again and claimed his 
realm. But the father had learned from experience and already 
knew for a long time how everything would turn out. After the

son had voiced his demand, the old king got up from his throne 
and embraced his son with tears of joy and crowned him king 
‘And so the son, who had thus become king, was grateful to his 
father and held him in high esteem, as long as his father was 
granted life.” 


But I spoke to my serpent: “In truth, my serpent, I didn’t know 
that you are also a teller of fairy tales. So tell me, how should I 
interpret your fairy tale?” 

Se: “Imagine that you are the old king and have a son.” 

I: “Who is the son?” 

Se: “Well, I thought that you had just spoken of a son who 
doesn’t make you very happy” 

I: "What? You don't mean—that I should crown him?” 

Se: "Yes, who else?” 

I: “That's uncanny. But what about the sorceress?” 

Se: “The sorceress is a motherly woman whose son you should, 
be, since you are a child renewing himself in you.” 

1: “Oh no, willie be impossible for me to be a man?” 

Se: “Sufficient manhood, and beyond that fullness of child- 
hood. Which is why you need the mother.” 

I: “Pm ashamed to be a child.” 

Se: “And thus you kill your son. A creator needs the mother, 
since you are not a woman.” 

I: "This is a terrible truth. I thought and hoped that I could be 
aman in every way.” 

Se: “You cannot do this for the sake of the son. To create 
means: mother and child.” 

I:"The thought that I must remain a child is unbearable.” 

Se: "For the sake of your son you must be a child and leave him 
the crown.” 

I:"The thought that I must remain a child is humiliating and 
shattering,” 

Se: °A salutary antidote against power! Don't resist being a 
child, otherwise you resist your son, whom you want above al.” 

I: “Ie true, I want the son and survival. But the price for this 
is high.” 

Se: “The son stands higher. You are smaller and weaker than 
the son, That is a bitter truth, but it can’t be avoided. Don’t be 
defiant, children must be well-behaved.” 

I: ‘Damned scorn!” 

Se: “Man of mockery! I'l have patience with you. My wells 
should flow for you and pour forth the drink of salvation, if all 
lands parch with thirst and everyone comes to you begging for the 
water of life. So subject yourself to the son.” 

1: “Where am I going to take hold of the immeasurable? My 
knowledge and ability are poor, my power is not enough.” 

At which the serpent curled up, gathered herself into knots 
and said: “Do not ask after the morrow, sufficient unto you is the 
day. You need not worry about the means. Let everything grow, 
let everything sprout; the son grows out of himself” 


[2] The myth commences, the one that need only be lived, 
not sung, the one that sings itself, I subject myself to the son, 
the one engendered by sorcery, the unnaturally born, the son 
of the frogs, who stands at the waterside and speaks with his 
fathers and listens to their nocturnal singing. Truly he is full 
of mysteries and superior in strength to all men, No man has 
produced him, and no woman has given birth to him. 


The absurd has entered the age-old mother, and the son has 
grown in the deepest ground. He sprang up and was put to death. 
He rose again, was produced anew in the way of sorcery, and grew 
more swiftly than before, I gave him the crown that unites the 
separated, And so he unites the separated for me. I gave him the 
power and thus he commands, since he is superior in strength and 
cleverness to all others 

I did not give way to him willingly, but out of insight. No 
man binds Above and Below together. But he who did not grow 
like a man, and yet has the form of a man, is capable of binding 
them, My power is paralyzed, but I survive in my son. I set aside 
my concern that he may master the people. I am solitary, the 
people rejoice at him. I was powerful, now I am powerless. I was 
strong, now I am weak. Since then he has taken all the strength 
into himself. Everything has turned itself upside down for me 

1 loved the beauty of the beautiful, the spirit of those rich in 
spirit, the strength of the strong; I laughed at the stupidity of the 
stupid, I despised the weakness of the weak, the meanness of the 
mean, and hated the badness of the bad. But now I must love the 
beauty of the ugly, the spirit of the foolish, and the strength of the 
weak. I must admire the stupidity of the clever, must respect the 
‘weakness of the strong and the meanness of the generous, and 
honor the goodness of the bad. Where does that leave mockery, 
contempt, and hatred? 

They went over to the son as a token of power. His mockery 
is bloody, and how contemptuously his eyes flash! His hatred is a 
singing fire! Enviable one, you son of the Gods, how can one fail 
to obey you? He broke me in two, he cut me up. He yokes the 
separated. Without him T would fall apart, but my life went on 
with him, My love remained with me. 


‘Thus I entered solitude with a black look on my face, full of 
resentment and outrage at my son’s dominion, How could my son 
arrogate my power? I went into my gardens and sat down in a 
lonely spot on rocks by the water, and brooded darkly: I called the 
serpent, my nocturnal companion, who lay with me on the rocks 
through many twilights, imparting her serpent wisdom, But then 
my son emerged from the water, great and powerful, the crown 
on his head, with a swirling lion’s mane, shimmering serpent skin 
covering his body; he said to me” 

{8} [1] “I come to you and demand your life.” 

I: "What do you mean? Have you even become a God?”* 

He: “T rise again, I had become flesh, now I return to eternal 
glitter and shimmer, to the eternal embers of the sun, and leave 
you your earthliness. You will remain with men, You have been in 
immortal company long enough. Your work belongs to the earth.” 

I: “What a speech! Weren't you wallowing in the earth and 
the underearth?” 

He:“I had become man and beast, and now ascend again to my 
own country.” 

I: “Where is your country?” 

He: “In the light, in the egg, in the sun, in what is innermost 
and compressed, in the eternal longing embers. So rises the sun 
in your heart and streams out into the cold world.” 

I: “How you transfigure yourself!” 

He; “I want to vanish from your sight. You ought to live in 
darkest solitude, men—not Gods—should illumine your darkness.”

1: “How hard and solemn you are! Ti like to bathe your feet 
my tears, dry them with my hair—I'm raving, am T a woman?” 

He; “Also a woman, also a mother, pregnant. Giving birth 
awaits you.” 

I:“Oh holy spirit, grant me a spark of your eternal light!” 

He: “You are with child” 

1: I feel the torment and the fear and the desolation of pregnant 
woman. Do you go from me, my God?” 

He: “You have the child.” 

I: "My soul, do you still exist? You serpent, you frog, you 
magically produced boy whom my hands buried; you ridiculed, 
despised, hated one who appeared to me in a foolish form? Woe 
betide those who have seen their soul and felt it with hands. I 
am powerless in your hand, my God!” 

He: “The pregnant woman belongs to fate. Release me, I rise 
to the eternal realm.” 

I: “Will I never hear your voice again? Oh damned deception! 
What am I asking? You'll talk to me again tomorrow, you'll chat 
over and over in the mirron” 

He: “Do not rail. I will be present and not present. You will 
hear and not hear me. I will be and not be.” 

1: “You utter gruesome riddles.” 

He: “Such is my language and to you I leave the understanding, 
No one besides you has your God, He is always with you, yet you 
see him in others, and thus he is never with you. You strive to 
draw to yourself those who seem to possess your God. You will 
come to see that they do not possess him, and that you alone have 
him. Thus you are alone among men—in the crowd and yet alone. 
Solitude in multitude—ponder this,” 

I: “I suppose I ought to remain silent after what you have 
said, but I cannot; my heart bleeds when I see you go from me.” 

‘He: “Let me go. I shall return to you in renewed form. Do you 
see the sun, how it sinks red into the mountains? This day's work 
is accomplished, and a new sun returns. Why are you mourning 
the sun of today?” 

I: “Must night fall?” 

He: “Is it not mother of the day?” 

I: "Because of this night I want to despair.” 

He: “Why lament? Ieis fate. Let me go, my wings grow and the 
longing toward eternal light swells up powerfully in me, You can 
no longer stop me. Stop your tears and let me ascend with cries 
of joy. You are a man of the fields, think of your crops. I become 
light, like the bird that rises up into the skies of morning. Do not 
stop me, do not complain; already I hover, the cry of life escapes 
from me, I can no longer hold back my supreme pleasure, I must 
go up—it has happened, the last cord tears away, my wings bear 
ime up. I dive up into the sea of light. You who are down there, 
you distant, twilight being—you fade from me.” 

I: “Where have you gone? Something has happened. I am 
lamed. Has the God not left my sight?” 


Where is the God? 

What has happened? 

How empty how utterly empty! Should I proclaim to men how 
you vanished? Should I preach the gospel of godforsaken solitude? 

Should we all go into the desert and strew ashes on our heads, 
since the God has left us?

An opus is needed, that one can squander decades on, and

354 In 1930, Jung stated: "A movement back into the Middle Ages i 2 sort of regression, bu tis not personal. Iti a historical regression, a regression into the past ofthe 
collective unconscious. This always takes place when the way ahead isnot free, when there isan obstacle from which you recoil or when you need to get something out 


of che past in order

Scrutinies 





Scrutinies 


{1} I resist, T cannot accept this hollow nothing that I am. 
What am I? What is my I? [always presuppose my I. Now it stands 
before me—I before my I. I speak now to you, my I: 

"We are alone and our being together threatens to become 
unbearably boring. We must do something, devise a pastime; for 
example, I could educate you. Let us begin with your main flaw, 
which strikes me first: you have no correct self-esteem. Have you 
no good qualities that you can be proud of? You believe that 
being capable is an art. But one can also learn such skills to some 
extent, Please, do so. You find it difficult—well, all beginnings 
are difficult Soon you will be able to do it better. Do you doubt 
this? That is of no use; you must be able to do it, or else I cannot 
live with you. Ever since the God has arisen and spreads himself 
whichever fiery heavens, to do whatever he does, what exactly 
1 do not know, we have depended upon one another. Therefore 
you must think about improving, or else our life together will 
become wretched, So pull yourself together and value yourself! 
Don't you want to? 

Pitiful creature! I will torment you a bit if you do not make an 
effort. What ate you moaning about? Perhaps the whip will help? 

‘Now that gets under your skin, doesn’t it? Take that—and that. 
‘What does it taste of? Of blood, presumably? Of the Middle Ages 
in majorem Det gloriam? 

Ordo you want love, or what goes by that name? One can also 
teach with love, if blows do not bear fruit. So should I love you? 
Press you tenderly to myself? 

1 truly believe that you are yawning 

How now, you want to speak? But I won't let you, otherwise in 
the end you will claim that you are my soul. But my soul is with 
the fire worm, with the son of the frog who has flown to the heavens 
above, to the upper sources. Do I know what he is doing there? 
Bur you are not my soul, you are my bare, empty nothing—I, this 
disagreeable being, whom one cannot even deny the right to 
consider itself worthless. 

One could despair over you: your sensitivity and desirousness 
exceed any reasonable measure. And I should live with you, of all 
people? I must, since the strange misfortune occurred that gave 
me a son and took him away. 

I regret that I must speak such truths to you. Yes, you 
are laughably sensitive, self-righteous, unruly, mistrustful, 
pessimistic, cowardly, dishonest with yourself, venomous, venge- 
fal; one can hardly speak about your childish pride, your craving 
for power, your desire for esteem, your laughable ambition, 
your thirst for fame without feeling sick. The playacting and 
pomposity become you badly and you abuse them to the best 
of your ability 

Do you believe that it is a pleasure rather than a horror to live 
together with you? No, three times no! But I promise you that I 
will tighten the vise around you and slowly pull off your skin. 1 
will give you the chance to be flayed 

You, you of all people wanted to tell other people what to do? 

Come here, I will stitch a cloth of new skin onto you, so that 
you can feel its effect. 

You want to complain about others, and that one has done an 
injustice to you, not understood you, misinterpreted you, hurt

2 “All beginnings ace difficult” is a proverb from the Talmud,

your feelings, ignored you, not recognized you, falsely accused 
you, and what else? Do you see your vanity in this, your eternally 
ridiculous vanity? 

‘You complain that the torment has not yet come to an end? 

Let me tell you: it has only just begun. You have no patience 
and no seriousness. Only when it concerns your pleasure do 
you praise your patience. I will double the torment so that you 
learn patience. 

You find the pain unbearable, but there are other things that 
hhurt even more, and you can inflict them on others with the 
greatest naivety and absolve yourself all unknowingly. 

But you will learn silence. For this 1 will pull out your 
tongue—with which you have ridiculed, blasphemed and—even 
worse—joked. I will pin all your unjust and depraved words 
one by one to your body with needles so that you can feel how 
evil words stab. 

Do you admit that you also derive pleasure from this torment? 
will increase this pleasure until you vomit with joy so that you 
know what taking pleasure in self-torment means, 

You rise against me? I am screwing the vise tighter, that’s 
all, I will break your bones until there is no longer a trace of 
hardness there 

For I want to get along with you—I must—damn you—you are 
my I, which I must carry around with me to the grave. Do you 
think that I want to have such foolishness around me all my life? 
Ifyou were not my I, I would have torn you to pieces long ago. 

But I am damned to haul you through a purgatory so that you 
100 will become somewhat acceptable. 

You call on God for help? 

The dear old God has died,‘ and it is good that way. otherwise 
he would have had pity on your repentant sinfulness and spared 
me the execution by granting mercy. You must know that nei- 
ther a God of love nor a loving God has yet arisen, but instead 
a worm of fire crawled up, a magnificent frightful entity that 
lets fire rain on the earth, producing lamentations. So cry to the 
God, he will burn you with fire for the forgiveness of your sins. 
Coil yourself and sweat blood, You have needed this cure for a 
long time. Yes—others always do wrong—and you? You are the 
innocent, the correct, you must defend your good right and you 
have a good, loving God on your side, who always forgives sins 
with pity. Others must reach insight, not you, since you have a 
monopoly on all insight from the start and are always convinced 
that you are right. And so cry really loudly to your dear God—he 
will hear you and let fire fall on you. Have you not noticed that 
your God has become a fiery worm with a flat skull who crawls 
red-hot on the earth? 

‘You wanted to be superior! How laughable. You were, and are, 
inferior. Who are you, then? Scum that disgusts me. 

‘Are you perhaps somewhat powerless? I place you in a corner 
where you can remain lying until you come to your senses again. 
Ifyou no longer feel anything, the procedure is of no use. After 
all, we must proceed skillfully. It really says a lot about you that 
cone needs such barbaric means for your amendment. Your progress 
since the early Middle Ages appears to be minuscule. 


“Did you feel dejected today, inferior, debased? Shall I tell 
you why?

334 | SCRUTINIES 


Your inordinate ambition is boundless, Your grounds are not 
focused on the good of the matter but on your vanity. You do not 
‘work for humanity but for your self-interest. You do not strive for 
the completion of the thing but for the general recognition and 
safeguarding of your own advantage. I want to honor you with a 
prickly crown of iron; it has teeth inside that bore themselves 
into your flesh 

And now we come to the vile swindle that you pursue with your 
cleverness. You speak skillfully and abuse your capability and 
discolor, tone down, strengthen, apportion light and shade, and 
loudly proclaim your honorableness and upright good faith. You 
exploit the good faith of others, you gloatingly catch them in your 
snares and speak of your benevolent superiority and the pri: 
that you are for others, You play at modesty and do not mention 
your merit, in the certain hope that someone else will do it for 
‘you; you are disappointed and hurt if this doesn’t happen. 

‘You preach hypocritical composure, But when it really matters, 
are you calm? No, you lie. You consume yourself in rage and your 
tongue speaks cold daggers and you dream of revenge 

You are gloating and resentful. You begrudge the other the 
sunshine, since you would like to assign it to those whom you 
favor because they favor you. You are envious of all well-being 
around you and you impertinently assert the opposite. 

Inside yourself you think unsparingly and coarsely only what 
always suits you, and with this you feel yourself above human- 
ity and not in the least responsible, But you are responsible to 
humanity in everything that you think, feel, and do, Do not pretend 
there isa difference between thinking and doing. You rely only on 
your undeserved advantage, not to be compelled to say or do what 
you think and feel 

Bur you are shameless in everything where no one sees you. 
If another said that to you, you would be mortally offended, 
despite knowing that it is true, You want to reproach others for 
their failings? So that they better themselves? Yes, confess, have 
you bettered yourself? From where do you get the right to have 
opinions of others? What is your opinion about yourself? And 
what are the good grounds that support it? Your grounds are 
webs of lies covering a dirty comer, You judge others and charge 
them with what they should do. You do this because you have no 
order within yourself, because you are unclean. 

‘And then—how do you really think? It appears to me that you 
even think with men, regardless of their human dignity; you dare 
think by means of them, and use them as figures on your stage, as 
if they were how you conceive them? Have you ever considered 
that you thus commit a shameful act of power, as bad as that for 
which you condemn others, namely that they love their fellow 
men, as they claim, but in reality exploit them to their own ends. 
‘Your sin flourishes in seclusion, but itis no less great, remorseless, 
and coarse. 

What is concealed in you I will drag out into the light, 
shameless one! I will crush your superiority under my feet. 

Do not speak to me about your love. What you call love oozes 
with self-interest and desirousness, But you speak about it with 
‘great words, and the greater your words are, the more pathetic 





7 Apel 21,1914 


your so-called love is. Never speak to me of your love, but keep 
your mouth shut, It lies 

I want you to speak about your shame, and that instead of 
speaking great words, you utter a discordant clamor before 
those whose respect you wanted to exact. You deserve mockery, 
not respect 

Iwill burn out of you the contents of which you were proud, so 
that you will become empty like a poured-out vessel. You should 
be proud of nothing more than your emptiness and wretchedness. 
You should be a vessel of life, so kill your idols. 

Freedom does not belong to you, but form; not power, but 
suffering and conceiving 

‘You should make a virtue out of your self-contempt, which I 
will spread out before men like a carpet. They should walk over it 
with dirty feet and you should see to it that you are dirtier than 
all the feet that step on you. 

VIF I tame you, beast, I give others the opportunity to tame 

their beasts. The taming begins with you, my I, nowhere else, Not 
that you, stupid brother I, had been particularly wild. There are 
some who are wilder. But I must whip you until you endure the 
wildness of the others. Then I can live with you. If someone does 
you wrong, I will torment you to death, until you have forgiven 
the wrong suffered, yet not just by paying lip service, but also in 
your heavy heart with its heinous sensitivity. Your sensitivity is 
your particular form of violence. 
Therefore listen, brother in my solitude, I have prepared every 
\d of torture for you, if it should ever occur to you again to be 
sensitive, You should feel inferior. You should be able to bear the 
fact that one calls your purity dirty and that one desires your 
dirtiness, that one praises your wastefulness as miserliness and 
your greed as a virtue. 

Fill your beaker with the bitter drink of subjugation, since you 
are not your soul. Your soul is with the fiery God who flamed up 
to the roof of the heavens. 





Should you still be sensitive? I notice that you are forging 
secret plans for revenge, plotting deceitful tricks. But you are an 
idiot, you cannot take revenge on fate. Childish one, you probably 
even want to lash the sea, Build better bridges instead; that is a 
better way to squander your wit. 

‘You want to be understood? That’ all we needed! Understand 
yourself, and you will be sufficiently understood. You will have 
quite enough work in hand with that. Mothers’ little dears 
want to be understood, Understand yourself, that is the best 
protection against sensitivity and satisfies your childish longing 
to be understood, I suppose you want to turn others into slaves of 
your desirousness again? But you know that I must live with you 
and that I will no longer tolerate such abject plaintiveness 


{a} After I had spoken these and many more angry words to my 
I, I noticed that I began to bear being alone with myself, But 
the rouchiness still stirred in me frequently and I had to lash 
myself just as often, And I did this until even the pleasure in 
self-torment faded? 


8 Jung later described the self-criticism depicted in this opening section as the confrontation with the shadow. In 1934 he wrote: “Whoever looks into the micros of the 
‘water will se first of al his own image. Whoever goes to himself risks a confrontation with himself. The micror does not fates, i faithfully shows whatever looks into 
ic namely the face we never show to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask ofthe acto. Bue the mirvor lies behind the mask and shows the tue face. 
‘This confzontation isthe fis tes of courage on che inner way, atest suficient to frighten off most people, forthe meeting with ourselves belongs to the more unpleasant 
things that can be avoided as long as one can project everything negative into the envigonment, But if we ate able to see our ovin shadow and can bear knowing about i, 
‘hen a small part ofthe problem has already been solved: we have at least brought up the personal unconscious" (On the archetypes of the collective unconscious,” CW 


9,1, §§43~48) 


9 This paragraph does not occur in BlackBook 5. On April 30, 194, Jung resigned as a lecturer inthe medical faculty ofthe University of Zrich, 


“Then I heard a voice one night; it came from afar and was the 
voice of my soul. She spoke: “How distant you are!” 

1: “Is that you my soul, from which height and distance do 
you speak?” 

S:"Lam above you. I am a world apart. I have become sunlike. 
1 received the seeds of fire. Where are you? I can hardly find you 
in your mists.” 

I: “I am down on the murky earth, in the dark smoke that 
the fire left us, and my gaze does not reach you, But your voice 
sounds closer.” 

"I feel it. The heaviness of the earth penetrates me, damp cold 
enshrouds me, gloomy memories of former pain overcome me.” 

I: "Do not lower yourself into the smoke and the darkness of 
the earth. I would like that which I am still working on to remain. 
sunlike, Otherwise I will lose the courage to live further down in 
the darkness of the earth. Let me just hear your voice. I will never 
want to see you in the flesh again. Say something! Take it from the 
depths, from which fear perhaps flows to me.” 

S: “I cannot, since your creative source flows from there.” 

I: “You see my uncertainty.” 

S:"The uncertain way is the good way. Upon it lie possibilities. 
Be unwavering and create.” 

I heard the rushing of wings. I knew that the bird rose 
higher, above the clouds in the fiery brilliance of the outspread 
Godhead, 

"turned to my brother, the I; he stood sadly and looked at the 
ground and sighed, and would rather have been dead, since the 
burden of enormous suffering burdened him, But a voice spoke 
from me and said: 

“Ie is hard—the sacrificed fall left and right—and you will be 
crucified for the sake of life.” 

‘And I said to my I: “My brother, how do you like this speech?” 

Buthe sighed deeply and moaned: “It is bitter, and I suffer much.” 

To which I answered; “I know, but it is not to be altered.” But 
1 did not know what that was, since I still did not know what the 
future held (this happened on the 21st May of the year 1914). In 
the excess of suffering I looked up to the clouds and called out to 
my soul and asked her. And I heard her voice, happy and bright, 
and she answered: 

“Much happiness has happened to me. I rise higher, my 
wings grow.” 

I was seized with bitterness at these words and I cried: “You 
live from the blood of the human heart.” 

T heard her laughing—or was she not laughing? “No drink is 
dearer to me than red blood.” 

Powerless anger seized me and I called out: “If you were not 
my soul who followed the God to the eternal realm, I would 
call you the most terrible scourge of men. But who moves you? 
I know that divinity is not humanity. The divine consumes the 
human. I know that this is the severity, this is the cruelty; he who 
haas felt you with his hands can never remove the blood from his 
hands. I have become enslaved to you.” 

She answered: “Do not be angry, do not complain. Let the 
bloody victims fall at your side. It is not your severity, it is 
not your cruelty, but necessity. The way of life is sown with 
fallen ones.”

1: “Yes, I see, it isa battlefield. My brother, what is with you? 
Are you groaning?” 

Then my I answered: “Why should I not groan and moan? I 
load myself with the dead and cannot hau! their number.” 

But I did not understand my I and therefore spoke to him: 
“You are a pagan, my friend! Have you not heard that it is said, 
let the dead bury their dead?” Why do you want to be burdened 
with the dead? You do not help them by hauling them.” 

Then my I wailed: “But I pity the poor fallen ones, they cannot 
reach the light. Pechaps if I haul them—?"

they could. Then they encountered fate, Itwill also happen to us. 
Your compassion is sick.” 

But my soul called from afar: “Leave him compassion, compassion 
binds life and death.” 

“These words of my soul stung me. She spoke of compassion, 
she, who rose up following the God without compassion, and T 
asked her: 

“Why did you do thar?” 

For my human sensitivity could not grasp the hideousness of 
that hour. She answered: 

“It is not meant for me to be in your world. I besmirch myself 
on the excrement of your earth.” 

I: “Am I not earth? Am I not excrement? Did I commit an 
error that forced you to follow the God into the upper realms?” 

S:"No, it was inner necessity. I belong to the Above.” 

I; “Has no one suffered an irreplaceable loss through 
your disappearance?” 

S: “On the contrary, you have enjoyed utmost benefit.” 

I: “IT heed my human feeling about this, doubt could come 
over me.” 

S:*What have you noticed? Why should what you see always be 
untrue? It is your particular wrong that you cannot stop making a 
fool of yourself, Can you not remain on your way for once?” 

1: "You know that I doubt, because of my love for men.” 

S: No, for the sake of your weakness, for the sake of your 
doubt and disbelief. Stay on your way and do not run away from 
yourself. There is a divine and a human intention. They cross 
cach other in stupid and godforsaken people, to whom you also 
belong from time to time.” 

Since what my soul spoke about referred to nothing that T 
could see, nor could I see what my I suffered from (since this 
happened two months before the outbreak of the wa), I wanted 
to understand it all as personal experiences within me, and 
consequently I could neither understand nor believe it al, since 
my belief is weak. And I believe that it is better in our time if, 
belief is weak. We have outgrown that childhood where mere 
belief was the most suitable means to bring men to what is good 
and reasonable, Therefore if we wanted to have a strong belief 
again today, we would thus return to that earlier childhood. But 
‘we have so much knowledge and such a thirst for knowledge in 
us that we need knowledge more than belief. But the strength of 
belief would hinder us from attaining knowledge. Belief certainly 
may be something strong, but it is empty, and too little of the 
whole man can be involved, if our life with God is grounded 
only on belief. Should we simply believe first and foremost? That

seems too cheap to me. Men who have understanding should not 
just believe, but should wrestle for knowledge to the best of their 
ability: Belief is not everything, but neither is knowledge. Belief 
does not give us the security and the wealth of knowing. Desiring 
knowledge sometimes takes away too much belief Both must 
strike a balance 

Bur it is also dangerous to believe too much, because today 
everyone has to find his own way and encounters in himself a 
beyond full of strange and mighty things. He could easily take 
everything literally with too much belief and would be nothing 
but a lunatic, The childishness of belief breaks down in the face 
of our present necessities. We need differentiating knowledge 
to clear up the confusion which the discovery of the soul has 
brought in. Therefore it is perhaps much better to await better 
knowledge before one accepts things all too believingly.* 

From these considerations I spoke to my sou!: 

“Is ll that to be accepted? You know in what sense I ask this. 
Iv is not stupid and unbelieving to ask thus, but is doubting of a 
higher type” 

“To this she answered: “I understand you—but its to be accepted” 

To which I replied: “The solitude of this acceptance terrifies 
me. I dread the madness that befalls the solitary” 

She answered: “As you already know, I have long predicted 
solitude for you. You need not be afraid of madness. What I 
predict is valid.” 

These words filled me with disquiet, since I felt that I could 
almost not accept what my soul predicted, because I did not 
understand it. I always wanted to understand it with regard to 
myself, Therefore I said to my soul: "What misunderstood fear 
torments me?” 

“That is your disbelief, your doubt. You do not want to believe 
in the size of the sacrifice that is required. But it will go on to the 
bitter end. Greatness requires greatness, You still want to be too 
cheap. Did I not speak to you of abandonment, of leaving be? 
Do you want to have it better than other men?” 

“No,” I replied, *No, that is not it. But I fear committing an 
injustice to men if I go my own way.” 

“What do you want to avoid?” she said; “there is no avoidance. 
You must go your way, unconcerned about others, no matter 
whether they are good or bad. You have laid your hand on the 
divine, which those have not.” 

could not accept these words since I feared deception. Therefore 
T also did not want to accept this way that forced me into dialogue 
with my soul, I preferred to speak with men. But I felt compelled 
toward solitude and I feared at the same time the solitude of 
my thinking which departed from accustomed paths." As I 
pondered this, my soul spoke to me: “Did I not predict dark 
solitude for you” 

“know,” I answered, “but I did not really think that it would 
hhappen. Must it be so?” 


“You can only say yes. There is nothing to do other than for 
you to take care of your cause. If anything should happen, it can 
only happen on this way.” 

“So it is hopeless,” I cried, “to resist solitude?” 

“Iris utterly hopeless. You should be forced into your work.” 

As my soul spoke thus, an old man with a white beard and a 
haggard face approached me. I asked him what he wanted with 
me. To which he replied: 

“I am a nameless one, one of the many who lived and died 
in solitude, The spirit of the times and the acknowledged truth 
required this from us. Look at me—you must learn this. Things 
have been too good for you.”” 

“But,” I replied, “is this another necessity in our so very dif- 
ferent time?” 

“Ie is as true today as it was yesterday, Never forget that you 
are aman and therefore you must bleed for the goal of humanity. 
Practice solitude assiduously without grumbling so that everything 
will in time become ready. You should become serious, and hence 
take your leave from science. There is too much childishness in it 
Your way goes toward the depths. Science is too superficial, mere 
language, mere tools, But you must set to work." 

1 did not know what work was mine, since everything was dark 
And everything became heavy and doubrful and an endless sadness 
seized me and lasted for many days. Then, one night, I heard the 
voice of an old man, He spoke slowly, heavily, and his sentences 
appeared to be disconnected and terribly absurd, so that the fear 
‘of madness seized me again.” For he spoke the following words 

"It is not yet the evening of days. The worst comes last. 

The hand that strikes first, strikes best. 

Nonsense streams from the deepest wells, amply like the Nile. 

Morning is more beautiful than night 

Flowers smell until they fade. 

Ripeness comes as late as possible in spring, or else it misses 

its purpose.” 


‘These sentences that the old man spoke to me on the night of 
the 25 May of the year 1914 appeared to me dreadfully meaningless. 
1 felt my I squirm in pain, Ie moaned and wailed about the burden 
of the dead that rested on it. It seemed as if it had to carry a 
thousand dead 

This sadness did not leave until the 24th June 1914." In the 
right my soul spoke to me: “The greatest comes to the smallest.” 
After this nothing further was said. And then the war broke out. 
This opened my eyes about what I had experienced before, and 
it also gave me the courage to say all of that which I have writeen 
in the earlier part of this book

large fish and rose up into the skies again clutching it.» I heard 
the voice of my soul, and she spoke: “That is a sign that what is 
below is borne upward.” 

Soon after this on an autumn night I heard the voice of an old 
‘man (and this time I knew that it was @AHMON).® He said: "I 
want to turn you around, I want to master you. I want to emboss 
you like a coin, I want to do business with you. One should buy 
and sell you." You should pass from hand to hand. Self-willing is 
not for you. You are the will of the whole. Gold is no master out 
of its own will and yet it rules the whole, despised and greedily 
demanded, an inexorable ruler: it lies and waits, He who sees 
i longs for it, It does not follow one around, but lies silently, 
with a brightly gleaming countenance, self-sufficient, a king 
that needs no proof of its power. Everyone seeks after it, few 
find it, but even the smallest piece is highly esteemed. It neither 
gives nor squanders itself, Everyone takes it where he finds it, 
and anxiously ensures that he doesn’t lose the smallest part of 
it. Everyone denies that he depends on it, and yet he secretly 
stretches out his hand longingly toward it, Must gold prove its 
necessity? It is proven through the longing of men. Ask it: who 
takes me? He who takes it, has it. Gold does not stir. It sleeps 
and shines. Its brilliance confuses the senses. Without a word, 
it promises everything that men deem desirable. It ruins those 
to be ruined and helps those on the rise to ascend. 

A blazing hoard is piled up, it awaits the taker. What 
tribulations do men not take upon themselves for the sake of 
gold? It waits and does not shorten their tribulations—the 
greater the tribulations, the greater the trouble, the more 
esteemed it is, It grows from underground, from the molten 
Java, It slowly exudes, hidden in veins and rocks, Man exerts all 
cunning to dig it out, to raise it.” 

But I called out dismayed: “What ambiguous speech, 
Oh @1AHMON!” 

"But @IAHMON continued: “Not only to teach, but also to 
disavow, or why then did I teach? If I do not teach, I do not 
have to disavow. But if I have taught, I must disavow there- 
after. For if I teach, I must give others what they should have 
taken, What he acquires is good, but the gift that was not 
acquired is bad, To waste oneself means: to want to suppress 
many, Deceitfulness surrounds the giver because his own 
enterprise is deceitful. He is forced to revoke his gift and to 
deny his virtue 


SCRUTINIES | 337 


The burden of silence is not greater than the burden of my 
self that I would like to load onto you. Therefore I speak and I 
teach. May the listener defend himself against my ruse, by means 
‘of which I burden him. 

The best truth is also such a skillful deception that I also 
entangle myself in it as long as I do not realize the worth of a 
successful ruse.” 

‘And I was startled again and cried: “Oh @1AHMON, men have 
deceived themselves about you, therefore you deceive them, But 
he who fathoms you, fathoms himselE” 

*But @IAHMON fell silent and retired into the shimmering 
cloud of uncertainty, He left me to my thoughts. And it occurred 
to me that high barriers would still need to be erected between 
men, less to protect them against mutual burdens than against 
mutual virtues, It seemed to me as if the so-called Christian 
morality of our time made for mutual enchantment, How 
can anyone bear the burden of the other, if itis still the high- 
est that one can expect from a man, that he at least bears his 
own burden. 

But sin probably resides in enchantment. If I accept self- 
forgetting virtue, I make myself the selfish tyrant of the other, 
and T am thus also forced to surrender myself again in order 
to make another my master, which always leaves me with a bad 
impression and is not to the other's advantage. Admittedly, this 
interplay underpins society, but the soul of the individual becomes 
damaged since man thus learns always to live from the other 
instead of from himself It appears to me that, if one is capable, 
one should not surrender oneself, as that induces, indeed even 
forces, the other to do likewise. But what happens if everyone 
surrenders themselves? That would be folly 

Not that it would be a beautiful or a pleasant thing to 
live with one’s self, but it serves the redemption of the self. 
Incidentally, can one give oneself up? With this one becomes 
one’s own slave. That is the opposite of accepting oneself, If one 
becomes one’s own slave—and this happens to everyone who 
surrenders himself—one is lived by the self. One does not live 
one's self; it lives itsel€” 

“The self-forgetting virtue is an unnatural alienation from one’s 
own essence, which is thus deprived of development. It is a sin 
to deliberately alienate the other from his self by means of one’s 
own virtuousness, for example, through saddling oneself with 
his burden, This sin rebounds on us"

It is submission enough, amply enough, if we subjugate 
ourselves to our self, The work of redemption is always first to be 
done on ourselves, if one dare utter such a great word. This work 
cannot be done without love for ourselves. Must it be done at all? 
Certainly not, fone can endure agiven condition and does not feel 
in need of redemption, The tiresome feeling of needing redemption 
can finally become too much for one. Then one seeks to rid oneself 
of it and thus enters into the work of redemption, 

It appears to me that we benefit in particular from removing 
every sense of beauty from the thought of redemption, and even 
need to do so, or else we will deceive ourselves again because we 
like the word and because a beautiful shimmer spreads out over 
the thing through the great word. But one can at least doubt 
whether the work of redemption is in itself a beautiful thing. The 
Romans did not find the hanged Jew exactly tasteful, and the 
gloomy excessive enthusiasm for catacombs around which cheap, 
barbaric symbols gathered probably lacked a pleasant shimmer 
in their eyes, given that their perverse curiosity for everything 
barbaric and subterranean had already been aroused. 

I think it would be most correct and most decent to say that 
one blunders into the work of redemption unintentionally, so to 
speak, if one wants to avoid what appears to be the unbearable 
evil of an insurmountable feeling of needing redemption. This 
step into the work of redemption is neither beautiful nor pleasant 
nor does it divulge an inviting appearance. And the thing itself 
is so difficult and full of torment that one should count oneself 
as one of the sick and not as one of the overhealthy who seek to 
impart their abundance to others. 

Consequently we should also not use the other for our own 
supposed redemption, The other is no stepping stone for our 
feet. It is far better that we remain with ourselves. The need for 
redemption rather expresses itself through an increased need 
for love with which we think we can make the other happy. But 
meanwhile we are brimming with longing and desire to alter our 
own condition. And we love others to this end. If we had already 
achieved our purpose, the other would leave us cold. But itis true 
that we also need the other for our own redemption. Pethaps he 
will lend us his help voluntarily, since we are in a state of sickness 
and helplessness. Our love for him is, and should not be, selfless. 
‘That would be a lic. For its goal is our own redemption. Selfless 
love is true only as long as the demand of the self can be pushed 
to one side. But someday comes the turn of the self, Who would 
want to lend himself to such a self for love? Certainly only one 
who does not yet know what excess of bitterness, injustice, and 
poison the self of a man harbors who has forgotten his self and 
made a virtue of it. 

In terms of the self, selfless love is a veritable sin. 

"We must presumably often go to ourselves to re-establish the 
connection with the self, since it is torn apart all too often, not 
only by our vices but also by our virtues. For vices as well as virtues 
always want to live outside, But through constant outer life we 


31 September 18, 1915, 


forget the self and through this we also become secretly selfish in 
our best endeavors What we neglect in ourselves blends itself 
secretly into our actions toward others. 

Through uniting with the self we reach the God. 

I must say this, not with reference to the opinions of the 
ancients or this or that authority, but because I have experienced 
it, It has happened thus in me. And it certainly happened in a 
way that I neither expected nor wished for. The experience of the 
God in this form was unexpected and unwanted. I wish I could 
say it was a deception and only too willingly would I disown this 
experience, But I cannot deny that it has seized me beyond all 
measure and steadily goes on working in me. So ifit is a deception, 
then deception is my God. Moreover, the God is in the deception. 
And if this were already the greatest bitterness that could happen 
to me, I would have to confess to this experience and recognize 
the God in it. No insight or objection is so strong that it could 
surpass the strength of this experience. And even if the God had 
revealed himself in a meaningless abomination, I could only avow 
that I have experienced the God in it. I even know that it is not 
100 difficult to cite a theory that would sufficiently explain my 
experience and join it to the already known. I could furnish this 
theory myself and be satisfied in intellectual terms, and yet this 
theory would be unable to remove even the smallest part of the 
knowledge that I have experienced the God. I recognize the God 
by the unshakeableness of the experience. I cannot help but 
recognize him by the experience. I do not want to believe it, I do 
not need to believe it, nor could I believe it. How can one believe 
such? My mind would need to be totally confused to believe such 
things. Given their nature, they are most improbable. Not only 
improbable but also impossible for our understanding. Only a sick 
brain could produce such deceptions. I am like those sick persons 
who have been overcome by delusion and sensory deception, But 
I must say that the God makes us sick. I experience the God in 
sickness. A living God afflicts our reason like a sickness. He fills 
the soul with intoxication, He fills us with reeling chaos. How 
many will the God break? 

‘The God appears to us in a certain state of the soul, Therefore 
wwe reach the God through the self "Not the self is God, although 
swe reach the God through the self. The God is behind the self 
above the self, the self itself, when he appears. But he appears as 
our sickness, from which we must heal ourselves We must heal 
‘ourselves from the God, since he is also our heaviest wound, 

For in the first instance the God's power resides entirely in 
the self, since the self is completely in the God, because we were 
not with the self We must draw the self to our side. Therefore 
‘we must wrestle with the God for the self. Since the God is an 
unfathomable powerful movement that sweeps away the self into 
the boundless, into dissolution. 

Hence when the God appears to us we are at first powerless, 
captivated, divided, sick, poisoned with the strongest poison, but 
drunk with the highest health.

Yet we cannot remain in this state, since all the powers of our 
body are consumed like fat in the flames, Hence we must strive to 
free the self from the God, so that we can live” 

"It is certainly possible and even quite easy for our reason to 
deny the God and to speak only of sickness, Thus we accept the 
sick part and can also heal it. But it will be a healing with loss. We 
lose a part of life. We go on living, but as ones lamed by the God. 
Where the fire blazed dead ashes lie 

believe thatwe have the choice: I preferred the living wonders 
ofthe God. I daily weigh up my whole life and I continue to regard 
the fiery brilliance of the God as a higher and fuller life than the 
ashes of rationality. The ashes are suicide to me. I could perhaps 
put out the fire but I cannot deny to myself the experience of 
the God. Nor can I cut myself off from this experience, I also do 
not want to, since I want to live. My life wants itself whole. 

Therefore I must serve my self. I must win it in this way. But I 
must win it so that my life will become whole. For it seems to me 
to be sinful to deform life where there is yet the possibility to live 
it fully. The service of the self is therefore divine service and the 
service of mankind, If I carry myself I relieve mankind of myself 
and heal my self from the God. 

I must free my self from the God,” since the God I experienced 
is more than love; he is also hate, he is more than beauty, he is 
also the abomination, he is more than wisdom, he is also mean- 
inglessness, he is more than power, he is also powerlessness, he 
is more than omnipresence, he is also my creature. 


In the following night, I heard the voice of @IAHMON again 
and he said” 

“Draw nearer, enter into the grave of the God. The place of 
your work should be in the vault. The God should not live in you, 
‘but you should live in the God.” 

“These words disturbed me since I had thought before pre- 
cisely to free myself from the God. But ®IAHMON advised me 
to enter even deeper into the God. 

Since the God has ascended to the upper realms, @IAHMON 
also has become different. He first appeared to me as a magician 
who lived in a distant land, but then I felt his nearness and, since 
the God has ascended, I knew that @IAHMON had intoxicated 
me and given me a language that was foreign to me and of a differ- 
ent sensitivity. All of this faded when the God arose and only 
@IAHMON kept that language. But I felt that he went on other 
‘ways than I did. Probably the most part of what I have written 
in the earlier part of this book was given to me by ®IAHMON® 
Consequently I was as if intoxicated. But now I noticed that 
@IAFIMON assumed a form distinct from me. 


{4} "Several weeks later, three shades approached me. I noticed 
from their chilly breath that they were dead. The first figure was 
that of a woman. She drew near and made a soft whirring sound,

the whirring of the wings of the sun beetle, Then I recognized 
her. When she was still alive, she recovered the mysteries of the 
Egyptians for me, the red sun disk and the song of the golden 
‘wings. She remained shadowy and I could hardly understand her 
words, She said: 

“Ie was night when I died—you still live in the day—there 
are still days, years ahead of you—what will you begin—Let me 
have the word—oh, that you cannot hear! How difficult—give 
me the word!” 

1 answered dismayed: “I do not know the word that you seek” 

But she cried: “The symbol, the mediators, we need the symbol, 
wwe hunger for it, make light for us.” 

“Wherefrom? How can I? I do not know the symbol that 
you demand.” 

But she insisted: “You can do it, reach for it.” 

And precisely at this moment the sign was placed in my hand 
and I looked at it filled with boundless astonishment. Then she 
spoke loudly and joyfully to mes 

“That is it, that is HAP, the symbol that we desired, that we 
needed. It is terribly simple, initially stupid, naturally godlike, the 
God's other pole. This is precisely the pole we needed.” 

“Why do you need HAP?** I replied 

“He is in the light, the other God is in the night.” 

“Oh,” I answered, “what’s that, beloved? The God of the spirit 
is in the night? Is that the son? The son of the frogs? Woe betide 
us, if he is the God of our day!” 

But the dead one spoke full of triumph: 

“He is the flesh spirit, the blood spirit, he is the extract of all 
bodily juices, the spirit of the sperm and the entrails, of the geni- 
tals, of the head, of the feet, of the hands, of the joints, of the 
bones, of the eyes and ears, of the nerves and the brain; he is the 
spirit of the sputum and of excretion.” 

“Are you of the devil?” I exclaimed fall of horror, “where does 
my flashing godly light remain?” 

But she said: “Your body remains with you, my beloved, your 
living body: The enlightening thought comes from the body” 

“What thought are you talking about? I recognize no such 
thought,” I said. 

“Ie crawls around like a worm, like a serpent, soon there, soon, 
here, a blind newt of Hell” 

“Then I must be buried alive. Oh horror! Oh rottenness! Must I 
attach myself completely, like a leech?” 

“Yes, drink blood,” she said, “suck it up, get your fill from the 
carcass, there is juice inside, certainly disgusting, but nourishing 
You should not understand, but suck!” 

“Damned horror! No, three times no,” I cried in outrage 

But she said: “It should not irritate you, we need this meal, 
the life juices of men, since we want to share in your life. Thus 
wwe can draw closer to you. We want to give you tidings of what 
you need to know” 


437 Black Books continues: “The God has the power, not che self Powerlessness should thus not be deplored, but i isthe condition that should abide. The God acts from 
‘within himself ‘This should be left co him. What we do to the self, we do to che God. / Ifwe ewist the self. we also twist the God. I is divine service to serve oneself

“That is horribly absurd! What are you talking about?” 

“But she looked at me as she had done on the day I had last 
seen her among the living, and on which she showed me, unaware 
of its meaning, something of the mystery of what the Egyptians had 
left behind. And she said to me 

“Do it for me, for us. Do you recall my legacy, the red sun 
disk, che golden wings and the wreath of life and duration? 
Immortality, of this there are things to know.” 

“The way that leads to this knowledge is Hell.” 

From this I sank into gloomy brooding since I suspected the 
heaviness and incomprehension and the immeasurable solitude 
of this way. And after a long struggle with all the weakness and 
cowardice in me, I decided to take upon myself this solitude of 
the holy error and the eternally valid truth. 

‘And in the third night I called to my dead beloved and asked 
her: 

“Teach me the knowledge of the worms and the crawling creatures, 
open to me the darkness of the spirits!” 

She whispered: “Give blood, so that I may drink and gain 
speech. Were you lying when you said that you would leave the 
power to the son?” 

“No, I was not lying, But I said something that 1 did 
not understand,” 

“You are fortunate,” she said, “if you can say what you do not 
understand. So listen: HAP® is not the foundation but the 
summit of the church thar still les sunken, We need this church 
since we can live init with you and take part in your life. You have 
excluded us to your own detriment.” 

“Tell me, is HAP for you the sign of the church in which you 
hope for community with the living? Speak, why do you hesitate?” 

She moaned and whispered with a weak voice: “Give blood, I 
need blood.”* 

“So take blood from my heart,” I spoke 

“I thank you,” she said, “that is fullness of life. The air of the 
shadow world is thin since we hover on the ocean of the air like 
birds above the sea. Many went beyond limits, fluttering on 
indeterminate paths of outer space, bumping at hazard into alien 
worlds, But we, we who are still near and incomplete, would like to 
immerse ourselves in the sea of the air and return to earth, to the 
living, Do you not have an animal form into which I can enter?” 

“What,” I exclaimed horrified, “you would like to be my dog?” 

“If possible, yes,” she replied, “I would even like to be your dog. 
“To me you are of unspeakable worth, all my hope, that still clings 
to earth, I would still like to see completed what I left too soon. 
Give me blood, much blood!” 

“So drink,” I said despairingly, “drink, so that what should be 
will be.” 

She whispered with a hesitant voice: “Brimo"—I guess that’s 
what you call her—the old one—which is how it begins—the one 
who bore the son—the powerful HAP, who grew out of her shame 
and strove after the wife of Heaven, who arches over earth, for 
Brimo, above and below, envelops the son. She bears and raises 
him. Born from below, he fertilizes the Above, since the wife is 
his mother, and the mother is his wife.”

“Accursed teaching! Is this still not enough of the horrifying 
Mysterium?" I cried full of outrage and abhorrence. 

“If Heaven becomes pregnant and can no longer hold its fruit, 
it gives birth to a man who carries the burden of sin—that is the 
tree oflife and of unending duration, Give me your blood! Listen! 
This riddle is terrible: when Brimo, the heavenly, was pregnant, 
she gave birth to the dragon, first the afterbirth and then the son, 
HAP. and the one who carried HAP. HAP is the rebellion of the 
Below, but the bird comes from the Above and places itself on the 
head of HAP. That is peace. You are a vessel. Speak, Heaven, pour 
outyour rain, You are a shell. Empty shells do not spill, they catch, 
May it stream in from all the winds. Let me tell you that another 
evening is approaching. A day, ewo days, many days have come 
to an end, The light of day goes down and illumines the shadow, 
itself'a shadow of the sun. Life becomes a shadow, and the shadow 
enlivens itself, the shadow that is greater than you. Do you think 
that your shadow is your son? He is small at midday, and fills the 
sky at midnight."* 

Bur I was exhausted and desperate and could hear no more, 
and so I said to the dead one: 

‘So you introduce the terrible son who lived beneath me, 
under the trees on the water? Is he the spirit that the heavens 
pour out, or is he the soulless worm that the earth bore? Oh 
Heaven—Oh most sinister womb! Do you want to suck the life 
out of me for the sake of the shadow? Should humanity thus 
completely go to waste for divinity? Should I live with shadows, 
instead of with the living? Should all the longing for the living 
belong to you, the dead? Did you not have your time to live? Did 
you not use it? Should a living person give his life for your sake, 
‘you who did not live the eternal? Speak, you mute shadows, who 
stand at my door and demand my blood!” 

The shadow of the dead one raised its voice and said: “You 
see—or do you still not see, what the living do with your life. 
“They fritter it away. But with me you live yourself since I belong 
to you. I belong to your invisible following and community. Do 
you believe that the living see you? They see only your shadow, 
not you—you servant, you bearer, you vessel— 

“How you hold forth! Am I at your mercy? Should I no longer 
see the light of day? Should I become a shadow with a living 
body? You are formless and beyond grasp, and you emanate 
the coldness of the grave, a breath of emptiness. To let myself 
be buried alive—what are you thinking of? Too soon, it seems 
to me, I must die first. Do you have the honey that pleases 
my heart and the fire that warms my hands? What are you, you 
mournful shadows? You specters of children! What do you want 
with my blood? Truly, you are even worse than men. Men give 
little, yet what do you give? Do you make the living? The warm 
beauty? Or joy pethaps? Or should all this go to your gloomy 
Hell? What do you offer in return? Mysteries? Will the living live 
from these? I regard your mysteries as tricks if the living cannot 
live from them.” 

But she interrupted me and cried: “Impetuous one, stop, you 
take my breath away. We are shadows; become a shadow and you 
will grasp what we give.”

“Ido not want to die to descend into your darkness.” 

“But,” she said, “you need not die. You must only let yourself 
be buried.” 

“In the hope of resurrection? No joking now!” 

But she spoke calmly: “You suspect what will happen. ‘Triple 
walls before you and invisibility—to Hell with your longing and 
feeling! Atleast you do not love us, so we will cost you less dearly 
than the men who roll in your love and patience and have you 
make a fool of yourself” 

“My dead one, I think you are speaking my language.” 

She replied to me scornfully: “Men love—and you! What an 
error! All this means is that you want to run away from your- 
self, What do you do to men? You tempt and coax them into 
megalomania, to which you fall victim.” 

“But it grieves me, pains me, howls at me; I feel a great longing, 
everything soft complains, and my heart yearns.” 

Bur she was unsparing. “Your heart belongs to us,” she said, 
“What do you want with men? Self-defense against men—so that 
you walk on your own two feet, not on human crutches. Men need 
the undemanding, but they are always wanting love to be able to 
run away from themselves, This ought to stop. Why do fools go 
‘out and preach the gospel to the negroes, and then ridicule it in 
their own country? Why do these hypocritical preachers speak of 
love, divine and human love, and use the same gospel to justify 
the right to wage war and commit murderous injustice? Above 
all, what do they teach others when they themselves stand up to 
their necks in the black mud of deception and self-deceit? Have 
they cleaned their own house, have they recognized and driven 
out their own devil? Because they do none of this, they preach 
love to be able to run away from themselves, and to do to others 
what they should do to themselves. But this greatly prized love, 
given to one’s own self, burns like fire. These hypocrites and liars 
have noticed this—as you have—and prefer to love others. Is 
that love? It is false hypocrisy. I always begins in yourself and 
in all things and above all with love. Do you believe that one who 
‘wounds himself unsparingly does the other a good deed with his 
love? No, of course you don’t believe it. You even know that he 
only teaches the other how one must wound oneself, so that he 
can compel others to express sympathy. Therefore you should be 
a shadow since this is what men need, How can they get away from 
the hypocrisy and foolishness of your love if you yourself cannot? 
For everything begins with yourself, But your horse still cannot 
refrain from whinnying, Even worse, your virtue is a wagging dog, 
a growling dog, a licking dog, a barking dog—and you call that 
human love! But love is: to bear and endure oneself. It begins with 
this. Ic is truly about you; you are not yet tempered; other fires 
must yet come over you until you have accepted your solitude and 
learned to love 

What do you ask about love? What is love? To live, above all, 
that is more than love. Is war love? You are bound to see what 
human love is still good enough for—a means like other means 
Therefore, above al, solitude, until every softness toward yourself 
has been burnt out of you. You should learn to freeze." 

“I see only graves before me,” I answered, “what cursed will is 
above me?” 

“The will of the God, that is stronger than you, you slave, you 
vessel. You have fallen into the hands of the greater. He knows 


SCRUTINIES | 341 


no pity: Your Christian shrouds have fallen, the veils that blinded 
your eyes. The God has become strong again. The yoke of men is 
lighter than the yoke of the God: therefore everyone seeks to yoke 
the other out of mercy, But he who does not fall into the hands 
of men falls into those of the God. May he be well and may woe 
betide him! There is no escape.” 

“Is that freedom?” I cried 

“The highest freedom, Only the God above you, through 
yourself, Comfort yourself with this and that as well as you 
can, The God bolts doors that you cannot open. Let your feelings 
whimper like puppies. The ears on high are deal” 

“But” I answered, “is there no outrage for the sake of 
the human?” 

“Outrage? I laugh at your outrage. The God knows only 
power and creation. He commands and you act. Your anxieties 
are laughable, There is only one road, the military road of 
the Godhead.” 

The dead one spoke these unsparing words to me.* As I did 
not want to obey anyone, I had to obey this voice. And she spoke 
unsparing words about the power of the God, I had to accept 
these words.” We have to greet a new light, a blood-red sun, 
a painful wonder. No one forces me to; only the foreign will 
in me commands and I cannot escape since I find no grounds 
todo so. 

The sun, appearing to me, swam in a sea of blood and wailing: 
therefore I said to the dead one 

“Should it be the sacrifice of joy?” 

But the dead one replied: “The sacrifice of all joy, provided 
that you do it yourself Joy should neither be made nor sought; it 
should come, if it must come. I demand your service. You should 
not serve your personal devil. That leads to superfluous pain. 
True joy is simple: it comes and exists from itself, and is not 
to be sought here and there. At the risk of encountering black 
night, you must devote yourself to me and seek no joy: Joy can 
never ever be prepared, but exists of its own accord or exists 
not at all, All you must do is fulfill your task, nothing else. Joy 
comes from fulfillment, but not from longing, I have the power. 
T.command, you obey.” 

“I fear that you will destroy me.” 

But she answered: “I am life that destroys only the unfit. 
“Therefore take care that you are no unapt tool. You want to rule 
yourself? You steer your ship onto the sand. Build your bridge, 
stone upon stone, but don’t think of wanting to take the helm. 
You go astray if you want to escape my service. There is no 
salvation without me. Why are you dreaming and hesitating?” 

“You see,” I answered, “that Iam blind and do not know where 
to begin.” 

“Ie always begins with the neighbor. Where is the church? 
Where is the community?” 

“This is pure madness,” I cried out indignantly, “why do you 
speak of a church? Am I a prophet? How can I claim such for 
myself? I am just a man who is not entitled to know any better 
than others.” 

But she replied: “I want the church, it is necessary for you and 
for others. Otherwise what are you going to do with those whom 
I force to your feet? The beautiful and natural will nestle into the 
terrible and dark and will show the way. The church is something

natural. The holy ceremony must be dissolved and become 
spirit, The bridge should lead out beyond humanity inviolable, 
fas, of the air. There is a community of spirits founded on outer 
signs with a solid meaning,” 

“Listen,” I cried, “that doesn’t bear thinking about, it’s 
incomprehensible.” 

But she continued: “Community with the dead is what both 
you and the dead need. Do not commingle with any of the dead, 
but stand apart from them and give to each his due. The dead 
demand your expiatory prayers.” 

‘And when she spoke these words, she raised her voice and 
evoked the dead in my name: 

“You dead, I call you. 

“You shades of the departed, who have cast off the torment of 
living, come here! 

“My blood, the juice of my life, will be your meal and your drink. 

“Sustain yourself from me, so that life and speech will 
be yours, 

“Come, you dark and restless ones, I will refresh you with my 
blood, the blood of a living one so that you will gain speech and 
life, in me and through me. 

“The God forces me to address this prayer to you so that you 
come to life. Too long have we left you alone. 

“Let us build the bond of community so that the living and the 
dead image will become one and the past will live on in the present. 

“Our desire pulls us to the living world and we are lost in 
our desire. 

“Come drink the living blood, drink your fill so that we will 
be saved from the inextinguishable and unrelenting power of 
vivid longing for visible, graspable, and present being 

“Drink from our blood the desire that begets evil, as quarrel, 
discord, ugliness, violent deed, and famishment 

“Take, eat, this is my body, that lives for you. Take, eat, drink, 
this is my blood, whose desite flows for yout 

“Come, celebrate a Last Supper with me for your redemption 
and mine. 

“I need community with you so that I fall prey neither to the 
community of the living nor to my desire and yours, whose envy 
is insatiable and therefore begets evi. 

“Help me, so that I do not forget that my desire is a sacrificial 
fire for you. 

“You are my community I live what I can live for the living, But 
the excess of my longing belongs to you, you shades. We need to 
live with you. 

“Be auspicious to us and open our closed spirit so that we 
become blessed with the redeeming light. May it happen thus!” 

‘When the dead one had ended this prayer, she turned to me 
again and said: 

“Greats the need of the dead. But the God needs no sacrificial 
prayer. He has neither goodwill nor ill will. He is kind and fearful, 
though not actually so, but only seems to you thus, But the dead 
hear your prayers since they are still of human nature and not 
free of goodwill and ill will. Do you not understand? The history 
of humanity is older and wiser than you, Was there a time when 
there were no dead? Vain deception! Only recently have men 
begun to forget the dead and to think that they have now begun 
the real life, sending them into a frenzy”

{s} When the dead one had uttered all these words, she 
disappeared. I sank into gloominess and dull confusion. When 
I looked up again, I saw my soul in the upper realms, hover~ 
ing irradiated by the distant brilliance that streamed from the 
Godhead." And I called out: 

“You know what has taken place. You see that it surpasses the 
power and understanding of a man, But I accept it for your sake 
and mine. To be crucified on the tree of life, Oh bitterness! Oh 
painful silence! If it weren’t you, my soul, who touched the fiery 
Heaven and the eternal fullness, how could 1? 

“I cast myself before human animals—Oh most unmanly 
torment! I must let my virtues, my best ability be torn apart, 
because they are still thorns in the side of the human animal. 
Not death for the sake of the best, but befouling and rending of 
the most beautiful for the sake of life. 

“Alas, is there nowhere a salutary deception to protect me from 
having the Last Supper with my carcass? The dead want to live 
from me. 

“Why did you see me as the one to drink the cess of humanity 
that poured out of Christendom? Haven't you had enough of 
beholding the fiery fullness, my soul? Do you still want to fly 
entire into the glaring white light of the Godhead? Into what 
shades of horror are you plunging me? Is the devil’s pool so deep 
that its mud sullies even your glowing robe? 

“Where do you get the right to do me such a foul deed? Let the 
beaker of disgusting filth pass from me.* But if this be not your 
will, then climb past fiery Heaven and lodge your charges and 
topple the throne of God, the dreadful, proclaim the right of men 
also before the Gods and take revenge on them for the infamous 
deed of humanity, since only Gods are able to spur on the human 
‘worm? to acts of colossal atrocity. Let my fate suffice and let men 
manage human destiny. 

“Ob my mother humanity, thrust the terrible worm of God, 
the strangler of men, from you. Do not venerate him for the sake 
of his terrible poison—a drop suffices—and what is a drop to 
him—who at the same time is all emptiness and all fullness?” 

‘As I proclaimed these words, I noticed that @IAHMON stood 
behind me and had given them to me. He came alongside me 
invisibly, and I felt the presence of the good and the beautiful 
And he spoke to me with a soft deep voice: 

“Remove, Oh man, the divine, too, from your soul, as far as 
you can manage. What a devilish farce she carries on with you, as 
long as she still arrogates divine power over you! She's an unruly 
child and a bloodthirsty daimon at the same time, a tormentor of 
humans without equal, precisely because she has divinity. Why? 
‘Where from? Because you venerate her. The dead too want the 
same thing. Why don’t they stay quiet? Because they have not 
crossed over to the other side. Why do they want sacrifice? So 
y can live. But why do they still want to live with men? Because 
they want to rule. They have not come to an end with their craving 
for power, since they died still lusting for power. A child, an old 
man, an evil woman, a spirit of the dead, and a devil are beings 
who need to be humored. Fear the soul, despise her, love her, just 
like the Gods. May they be far from us! But above all never lose 
them! Because when lost they are as malicious as the serpent, as 
bloodthirsty as the tiger that pounces on the unsuspecting from 
behind. A man who goes astray becomes an animal, a lost soul

becomes a devil. Cling to the soul with love, fear, contempt, and 
hate, and don’t let her out of your sight. She is a hellish-divine 
treasure to be kept behind walls of iron and in the deepest 
vault, She always wants to get out and scatter glittering beauty. 
Beware, because you have already been betrayed! You'll never 
find a more disloyal, more cunning and heinous woman than 
your soul. How should I praise the miracle of her beauty and 
perfection? Does she not stand in the brilliance of immortal 
youth? Is her love not intoxicating wine and her wisdom the 
primordial cleverness of serpents? 

“Shield men from her, and her from men, Listen to what she 
wails and sings in prison but don't let her escape, as she will 
immediately turn whore, As her husband you are blessed through 
her, and therefore cursed. She belongs to the daimonic race 
of the Tom Thumbs and giants, and is only distantly related to 
humankind. If you seek to grasp her in human terms you will be 
beside yourself: The excess of your rage, your doubt, and your love 
belong to her, but only the excess. If you give her this excess, 
humanity will be saved from the nightmare. For if you do not 
see your soul, you see her in fellow men and this will drive you 
mad, since this devilish mystery and hellish spook can hardly be 
seen through 

“Look at man, the weak one in his wretchedness and torment, 
whom the Gods have singled out as their quarry—tear to pieces 
the bloody veil that the lost soul has woven around man, the 
cruel nets woven by the death-bringing, and take hold of the 
divine whore who still cannot recover from her fall from grace 
and craves filth and power in raving blindness, Lock her up like 
a lecherous bitch who would like to mingle her blood with every 
dirty cur. Capture her, may enough at last be enough. Let her for 
once taste your torment so that she will get to feel man and his 
hammer, which he has wrested from the Gods. 

“May man rule in the human world. May his laws be valid. But 
treat the souls, daimons, and Gods in their way, offering what 
is demanded. But burden no man, demand and expect nothing 
from him, with what your devil-souls and God-souls lead you to 
believe, but endure and remain silent and do piously what befits 
your kind, You should act not on the other but on yourself, unless 
the other asks for your help or opinion. Do you understand what 
the other does? Never—how should you? Does the other under- 
stand what you do? Whence do you take the right to think about 
the other and act on him? You have neglected yourself, your 
garden is full of weeds, and you want to teach your neighbor 
about order and provide evidence for his shortcomings. 

“Why should you keep silent about the others? Because there 
would be plenty to discuss concerning your own daimons. But 
if you act on and think about the other without him soliciting 
your opinion or advice, you do so because you cannot distinguish 
yourself from your soul. Therefore you fall victim to her presumption 
and help her into whoring. Or do you believe that you must lend 
your human power to the soul or the Gods, or even that it will be 
useful and pious work if you want to bring the Gods to bear 
on others? Blinded one, that is Christian presumptuousness. The 
Gods don’t need your help, you laughable idolater, who seem to 
yourself like a God and want to form, improve, rebuke, educate, 
and create men. Are you perfect yourself?—therefore remain 
silent, mind your business, and behold your inadequacy every day. 
You are most in need of your own help: you should keep your 
opinions and good advice ready for yourself and not run to 
others like a whore with understanding and the desire to help.

‘You don’t need to play God. What are daimons, who don’t act out 
of themselves? So let them go to work, but not through you, or else 
you yourself will become a daimon to others; leave them to them- 
selves and don't pre-empt them with awkward love, concern, care, 
advice, and other presumptions. Otherwise you would be doing 
the work of the daimons; you yourself would become a daimon 
and therefore go into a frenzy. But the daimons are pleased at 
the raving of helpless men advising and striving to help others. 

So stay quiet, fulfill the cursed work of redemption on yourself, 
for then the daimons must torment themselves and in the same 
way all your fellow men, who do not distinguish themselves from 
their souls and let themselves be mocked by daimons, Is it cruel 
to leave your blinded fellow human beings to their own devices? 
Ie would be cruel if you could open their eyes, But you could open 
their eyes only if they solicited your opinion and help. Yet if they 
do not, they do not need your help. If you force your help on 
them nonetheless, you become their daimon and increase their 
blindness, since you set a bad example. Draw the coat of patience 
and silence over your head, sit down, and leave the daimon to 
accomplish his work. If he brings something about, he will 
work wonders. Thus will you sit under fruit-bearing trees. 

“Know that the daimons would like to inflame you to embrace 
their work, which is not yours. And, you fool, you believe that itis 
you and that itis your work. Why? Because you can't distinguish 
yourself from your soul, But you are distinct from her, and you 
should not pursue whoring with other souls as if you yourself 
‘were a soul, but instead you are a powerless man who needs all 
his force for his own completion. Why do you look to the other? 
‘What you see in him lies neglected in yourself. You should be 
the guard before the prison of your soul. You are your soul's 
eunuch, who protects her from Gods and men, or protects the 
Gods and men from her. Power is given to the weak man, a poison 
that paralyzes even the Gods, like a poison sting bestowed upon 
the little bee whose force is far inferior to yours. Your soul could 
seize this poison and thereby endanger even the Gods. So put the 
soul under wraps, distinguish yourself from her, since not only 
your fellow men but also the Gods must live.” 

When @IAHMON had finished, I turned to my soul, who 
had come nearer from above during ®IAHMON’s speech, and spoke 
toher: 

“Have you heard what @1AHMON has been saying? How does 
this tone strike you? Is his advice good?” 

But she said, "Do not mock, or else you strike yourself. Do not 
forget to love me.” 

“Ivis difficult for me to unite hate and love,” I replied. 

“understand,” she said, “yet you know that it is the same. Hate 
and love mean the same to me. Like all women of my kind, form 
matters less to me than that everything belong to me or else 
to no one. I am also jealous of the hate you give others. I want 
everything, since I need everything for the great journey that 
1 intend to begin after your disappearance. I must prepare in 
good time. Until then I must make timely provision and much 
is still lacking” 

“And do you agree that I throw you into prison” I asked. 

“OF course,” she answered, “there I have peace and can collect 
myself Your human world makes me drunk—so much human 
blood—I could get intoxicated on it to the point of madness. 
Doors of iron, walls of stone, cold darkness and the rations of 
penance—that is the bliss of redemption. You do not suspect my 
torment when the bloody intoxication seizes me, hurls me again

and again into living matter from a dark fearful creative urge that 
formerly brought me close to the lifeless and ignited the terrible 
lust for procreation in me. Remove me from conceiving matter, the 
rutting feminine of yawning emptiness. Force me into confinement 
where I can find resistance and my own law, Where I can think 
about the journey, the rising sun the dead one spoke of, and the 
buzzing, melodious golden wings. Be thankful—don’t you want to 
thank me? You are blinded. You deserve my highest thanks” 

Filled with delight at these words, I cried: 

“How divinely beautiful you are!” And at the same time fury 
seized me: 

“Oh bitterness! You have dragged me through sheer and utter 
Hell, you have tormented me nearly to death—and I long for 
your thanks. Yes, Iam moved that you thank me, The hound’s 
nature lies in my blood. Therefore I am bitter—for my sake, since 
how does it move you! You are divine and devilishly great, 
wherever and howsoever you are. As yet I am only your eunuch 
doorkeeper, no less imprisoned than you, Speak, you concubine 
of Heaven, you divine monster! Have I not fished you from 
the swamp? How do you like the black hole? Speak without 
blood, sing from your own force, you have gorged yourself 
on men.” 

‘Then my soul writhed and like a downtrodden worm turned. 
and cried out, “Pity, have compassion.” 

“Compassion? Have you ever had compassion for me? You 
brute bestial tormentor! You've never gotten past compassionate 
moods. You lived on human food and drank my blood. Has it 
‘made you fat? Will you learn to revere the torment of the human 
animal? What would you souls and Gods want without man? 
‘Why do you long for him? Speak, whore!” 

She sobbed, “My speech stops. I'm horrified at your accusation.” 

“Are you going to get serious? Are you going to have second 
thoughts? Are you going to learn modesty or perhaps even some 
other human virtue, you soulless soul-being? Yes, you have no 
soul, because you are the thing itself, you fiend. Would you like a 
human soul? Should I perhaps become your earthly soul so that 
‘you will have a soul? You see, I've gone to your school. I've learned. 
how one behaves as a soul, perfectly ambiguous, mysteriously 
untruthful and hypocritical.” 

While I spoke to my soul in this way, ®AHMON stood silently 
alittle distance off. But now he stepped forward, laid his hand on 
my shoulder, and spoke in my name 

*You are blessed, virgin soul, praised be your name, You are the 
chosen one among women. You are the God-beares. Praise be to 
you! Honor and fame be yours in eternity. 

“You live in the golden temple, The peoples come from afar 
and praise you. 

“We, your vassals, wait on your words, 

“We drink red wine, dispensing a sacrificial drink in recollection 
of the meal of blood that you celebrated with us. 

“We prepare a black chicken for a sacrificial meal in remembrance 
of the man who fed you. 

“We invite our friends to the sacrificial meal, carrying wreaths 
of ivy and roses in remembrance of the farewell you took from 
your saddened vassals and maids. 

“Let this day be a festival celebrating joy and life—the day 
upon which you, blessed one, commence the return journey from 
the land of men where you have learned how to be a soul 

“You follow the son who ascended and passed over.

“You carry us up as your soul and set yourself before the son of 
God, maintaining your immortal right as an ensouled being. 

“We are joyful, good things will follow you. We lend you strength 
‘We are in the land of men and we are alive.” 

‘After @IAHMON had ended, my soul looked saddened and 
pleased, and hesitated and yet hurried to prepare herself to leave 
us and to ascend again, happy at the regained freedom, But I 
suspected something secret in her, something that she sought to 
hide from me. Therefore I did not let her make off, but spoke 
to her: 

“What holds you back? What are you hiding? Probably a 
golden vessel, a jewel that you have stolen from men? Isn't that 
a gem, a piece of gold, shining through your robe? What is the 
beautiful ching that you robbed when you drank the blood of 
men and ate their sacred flesh? Speak the truth, for I see the lie 
on your face.” 

“haven't taken anything,” she answered annoyed. 

“You are lying, you want to cast suspicion on me, where you 
are lacking, ‘Those times when you could rob men unpunished are 
over. Surrender everything that is his sacred inheritance and that 
you have rapaciously claimed. You have stolen from the vassal and 
the beggar. God is rich and powerful, you can steal from him, His, 
kingdom knows no loss. Shameful liar, when will you finally stop 
plaguing and robbing your humanity?” 

But she looked at me as innocently as a dove and said gently: 

“I do not suspect you. I wish you well. I respect your right. I 
acknowledge your humanity. I do not take anything away from 
you. I do not withhold anything from you. You possess everything, 
I, nothing.” 

“Yet,” I exclaimed, “you lie insufferably. You possess not only 
that marvelous thing that belongs to me, but you also have access to 
the Gods and eternal fullness. Therefore surrender what you have 
stolen, lian” 

Now she was vexed and replied: 

“How can you? I no longer recognize you. You are crazy, even 
more: you are laughable, a childish ape, who extends his paw 
toward everything that glitters. But I will not allow what is mine 
to be taken from me.” 

Then I cried enraged, “You're lying, you're lying; I saw the 
gold, I saw the sparkling light of the jewel: I know it belongs to 
me. You ought not take that away from me. Give it back!” 

Then she broke out in defiant tears and said, “I don’t want to 
part with it, it’s too precious to me. Do you want to rob me of the 
last ornament?” 

“Embellish yourself with the gold of the Gods, bur not with 
the meager treasures of earthbound human beings. May you 
taste heavenly poverty after you have preached earthly poverty 
and necessity to your humankind, like a true and proper cleric 
fall of lies, who fills his belly and purse and preaches poverty.” 

“You torment me awfully” she wailed, “leave me just this one 
thing, You men still have enough. I cannot be without this very one, 
this incomparable one, for whose sake even the Gods envy men.” 

“I will not be unjust,” I replied, “But give me what belongs to 
me and beg for what you need from it. What is it? Speak!” 

“Alas, that I can neither keep it nor conceal it! I is love, warm, 
human love, blood, warm red blood, the holy source of life, the 
unification of everything separated and longed for” 

“So," I said, “itis love that you claim as a natural right and 
property, although you still ought to beg for it, You get drunk 





on the blood of man and let him starve, Love belongs to me. I 
want to love, not you through me. You'll crawl and beg for it ike 
a dog. You'll raise your hands and fawn like hungry hounds. I 
possess the key. I will be a more just administrator than you 
godless Gods. You will gather around the source of blood, the 
sweet miracle, and you will come bearing gifts so that you may 
receive what you need. I protect the holy source so that no 
God can seize it for himself. The Gods know no measure and 
no mercy. They get drunk on the most precious of draughts. 
Ambrosia and nectar“ are the flesh and blood of men, truly a 
noble meal. They waste the drink in drunkenness, the goods 
of the poor, since they have neither God nor soul presiding 
over them as their judges. Presumptuousness and excessive- 
ness, severity and callousness are your essence. Greed for the 
sake of greed, power for the sake of power, pleasure for the sake 
of pleasure, immoderation and insatiableness: this is how one 
recognizes you, you daimons. 

“Yes, you have yet to learn, you devils and Gods, you daimons 
and souls, to crawl in the dust for the sake of love so that from 
someone somewhere you snatch a drop of the living sweetness. 
Learn humility and pride from men for the sake of love. 

“You Gods, your first born son is man. He bore a terribly 
beautiful-ugly son of God who is renewal to you all, But this 
‘mystery, too, fulfills you: you bore a son of men who is my renewal, 
no less splendid-terrible, and his rule also will serve you.” 

‘Then @1AHMON approached me, raised his hand, and spoke: 

“Both God and man are disappointed victims of deception, 
blessedly blessed, powerlessly powerful. The eternally rich universe 
unfolds again in the earthly Heaven and the Heaven of the Gods, 
in the underworlds and in the worlds above. Separation once more 
comes to the agonizingly united and yoked. Endless multiplicity 
takes the place of what has been forced together, since only 
diversity is wealth, blood, and harvest.” 

A night and a day passed, and when night came again and 
I looked around I saw that my soul hesitated and waited, So I 
addressed her” 

“What, you're still here? Didn't you find the way or didn’t 
you find the words, which belong to me? How do you honor 
humankind, your earthly soul? Recall what I bore and suffered 
for you, how I wasted myself, how I lay before you and writhed, 
how I gave my blood to you! I have an obligation to lay on you: 
learn to honor humankind, for I saw the land that is promised to 
‘man, the land where milk and honey flows.” 

“I saw the land of the promised love. 

“I saw the splendor of the sun on that land 

“I saw the green forests, the golden vineyards and the villages 
of man, 

“I saw the towering mountains with hanging fields of 
eternal snow: 

“I saw the fruitfulness and fortune of the earth. 

“None but I saw the fortune of man. 

“You, my soul, force mortal men to labor and suffer for your 
salvation. I demand that you do this for the earthly fortune of

your abundance! I will remain silent, yes, I will leave you be, it

it, Where is your own salvation, if you fail in your duty to bring

will remain silent.” 

“Now then,” she said, “I want to set to work, But you must 
build the furnace. Throw the old, the broken, the worn out, the 
unused, and the ruined into the melting pot, so that it will be 
renewed for fresh use. 

“It is the custom of the ancients, the tradition of the ances- 
tors, observed since days of old. It is to be adapted for new use. 
It is practice and incubation in a smelter, a taking-back into the 
interior, into the hot accumulation where rust and brokenness 
are taken away through the heat of the fire. It is a holy ceremony, 
help me so that my work may succeed. 

“Touch the earth, press your hand into matter, shape it with 
care. The power of matter is great. Did HAP not come from 
matter? Is matter not the filling of emptiness? By forming matter, 
I shape your salvation. If you do not doubt the power of HAP, 
how can you doubt the power of its mother, matter? Matter is 
stronger than HAP, since HAP is the son of the earth, The hardest 
matter is the best; you should form the most durable matter. This 
strengthens thought.” 


{6} 1 did as my soul advised, and formed in matter the thoughts 
that she gave me. She spoke often and at length to me about the 
‘wisdom that lies behind us.* But one night she suddenly came 
to me with a sense of unease and anxiety and exclaimed:” “What 
am I seeing? What does the future harbor? Blazing fire? A 
fire hovers in the air—it draws near—a flame—many flames—a 
searing miracle—how many lights burn? My beloved, it is the 
mercy of the eternal fire—the breath of fire descends on you!” 

But I cried out in horror, “I fear something terrible and 
dreadful, Lam deeply afraid, since the things that you announced 
beforchand were awful—must everything be broken, burned, 
and destroyed?” 

“Patience,” she said and stared into the distance, “fire surrounds 
you~an immeasurable sea of embers.” 

“Don't torture me—what dreadful mysteries do you possess? 
Speak, I implore you. Or are you lying again, damned tormenting 
spirit, deceiving fiend? What are your treacherous specters 
supposed to mean?” 

But she answered calmly, “I also want your fear.” 

“What for? To torment me?” 

But she continued, “To bring it before the ruler of this world 
He demands the sacrifice of your fear. He appreciates your sacrifice. 
He’ has mercy upon you.” 

“Mercy upon me? What is that supposed to mean? I want 
to hide myself from him. My face shrinks from the ruler of this

“But you should come before him,” she said, “he has heard about

*You instilled this fear in me. Why did you give me away?” 

“You have been summoned to serve him.” 

But I moaned and exclaimed: “Thrice damned fate! Why can't 
you leave me in seclusion? Why has he chosen me for sacrifice? 
Thousands would gladly throw themselves before him! Why 
‘must it be me? I cannot, I don't want to.”

“Whatis my word?” I answered, “itis the stammering of a minor; 
itis my poverty and my incapacity, my inability to do otherwise

surface of the earth and smoke sweeps over it—a sea of fire rolls 
close in from the north, it is setting the towns and villages on 
fire, plunging over the mountains, breaking through the valleys, 
burning the forests—people are going mad—you go before the 
fire in a burning robe with singed hair, a crazy look in your eyes, a 
parched tongue, a hoarse and foul-sounding voice—you forge ahead, 
you announce what approaches, you scale the mountains, you go

fire's agony. You bear the mark of the fire and men are horrified

messenger of the burning agony. What fire? they ask, what fire? You 
stutter, you stammer, what do you know about a fire? I looked at 
the embers, I saw the blazing flames. May God save us.” 

“My soul,” I cried in despair, “speak, explain, what should I 
proclaim? The fire? Which fire?” 

“Look up, see the flames that blaze over your head—look up,

With these words my soul vanished. 

But I remained anxious and confused for many days. And 
my soul remained silent and was not to be seen. But one night 
a dark crowd knocked at my door, and I trembled with fear. 
Then my soul appeared and said in haste, “They are here and 
will tear open your door.” 

“So that the wicked herd can break into my garden? Should 
I be plundered and thrown out onto the street? You make me 
into an ape and a child’s plaything. When, Oh my God, shall

your cursed webs, go to Hell, you fools. What do you want

But she interrupted me and said, “What are you talking about? 
Let the dark ones speak.”

for me. What good are you, if you can’t even protect me from the 
devil's confusion?” 

“Be quiet,” she replied, “or else you'll disturb the work.” 

‘And as she spoke these words, behold, OIAHMON came up to

shoulder” Then I said to the dark ones, “So speak, you dead.” And 
immediately they cried in many voices," “We have come back from 
Jerusalem, where we did not find what we sought” We implore 
you to letus in, You have what we desire, Not your blood, but your 
light. That is it” 

‘Then @IAHMON lifted his voice and taught them, saying® (and 
this is the first sermon to the dead)" 


“Now hear: I begin with nothingness. Nothingness is the same 
as the fullness. In infinity full is as good as empty. Nothingness 
is empty and full. You might just as well say anything else about 
nothingness, for instance, that it is white, or black, or that it does 
not exist, or that it exists. That which is endless and eternal has 
no qualities, since it has all qualities.

“We call this nothingness or fullness the Pleroma.® Therein 
both thinking and being cease, since the eternal and endless 
possess no qualities. No one is in it, for he would then be distinct 
from the Pleroma, and would possess qualities that would 
distinguish him as something distinct from the Pleroma. 

“In the Pleroma there is nothing and everything, Ics fruitless 
to think about the Pleroma, for this would mean self-dissolution. 

“Creation is not in the Pleroma, but in itself. The Pleroma is 
the beginning and end of creation." It pervades creation, just as 
the sunlight pervades the air. Although the Pleroma is altogether 
pervasive, creation has no share in it, just as a wholly trans- 
parent body becomes neither light nor dark through the light 
pervading it. 

"We are, however, the Pleroma itself, for we are a part of the 
eternal and the endless, But we have no share therein, as we are 
infinitely removed from the Pleroma; not spatially or temporally, 
but essentially, since we are distinguished from the Pleroma in our 
essence as creation, which is confined within time and space, 

“Yet because we are parts of the Pleroma, the Pleroma is also 
in us. Even in the smallest point the Pleroma is endless, eternal, 
and whole, since small and great are qualities that are contained 
in it. It is nothingness that is whole and continuous throughout. 
Only figuratively, therefore, do I speak of creation as part of 
the Pleroma, Because, actually, the Pleroma is nowhere divided, 
since it is nothingness. We are also the whole Pleroma, because, 
figuratively, the Pleroma is the smallest point in us, merely 
assumed, not existing, and the boundless firmament about us. 
But why then do we speak of the Pleroma at all, if it is everything 
and nothing? 

“I speak about it in order to begin somewhere, and also to free 
you from the delusion that somewhere without or within there 
is something fixed or in some way established from the outset. 
Every so-called fixed and certain thing is only relative. That alone 
is fixed and certain that is subject to change. 

“Creation, however, is subject to change; therefore it alone 
s fixed and determined because it has qualities: indeed, it is 
quality itself 

“Thus we ask: how did the creation come into being? Creatures 
came into being, but not creation: since creation is the very 
quality of the Pleroma, as much as noncreation, eternal death, 
Creation is ever-present, and so is death. The Pleroma has 
everything, differentiation and nondifferentiation 

“Differentiation is creation. It is differentiated. Differentiation 
is its essence, and therefore it differentiates, Therefore man

differentiates, since his essence is differentiation. Therefore he also 
differentiates the qualities of the Pleroma that do not exist. He 
differentiates them on account of his own essence. Therefore he 
must speak of those qualities of the Pleroma that do not exis. 

"You say: ‘what use is there in speaking about it at all?” 
Did you yourself not say that it is not worth thinking about 
the Pleroma? 

“I mentioned that to free you from the delusion that we are 
able to think about the Pleroma. When we distinguish the 
qualities of the Pleroma, we are speaking from the ground of our 
own differentiated state and about our own differentiation, but 
have effectively said nothing about the Pleroma. Yet we need to 
speak about our own differentiation, so that we may sufficiently 
differentiate ourselves, Our very nature is differentiation. If 
wwe are not true to this nature we do not differentiate ourselves 
enough. We must therefore make distinctions between qualities. 

*You ask: ‘what harm is there in not differentiating oneself?” 
If we do not differentiate, we move beyond our essence, beyond 
creation, and we fall into nondifferentiation, which is the other 
quality of the Pleroma. We fall into the Pleroma itself and cease 
to be created beings. We lapse into dissolution in nothingness 
This is the death of the creature. Therefore we die to the same 
extent that we do not differentiate. Hence the creature's essence 
strives roward differentiation and struggles against primeval, 
perilous sameness. This is called the principium individuationis* 
This principle is the essence of the creature. From this you can 
see why nondifferentiation and nondistinction pose a great 
danger to the creature. 

“We must, therefore, distinguish the qualities of the Pleroma. 
These qualities are pais of opposites, such as 


“the effective and the ineffective, 

the fullness and the emptiness, 

the living and the dead, 

the different and the same, 

light and darkness, 

hot and cold,

do not exist, because they cancel themselves out. As we are the

Pleroma itself, we also have all these qualities in us. Since our 
nature is grounded in differentiation, we have these qualities in 
the name and under the sign of differentiation, which means 

“First: these qualities are differentiated and separate in us; 
therefore they do not cancel each other out, but are effective. 
“Thus we are the victims of the pairs of opposites, The Pleroma is 
rent within us 

“Second: these qualities belong to the Pleroma, and we must 
possess and live them only in the name and under the sign 
of differentiation, We must differentiate ourselves from these 
qualities. They cancel each other out in the Pleroma, but not in 
us. Distinction from them saves us. 

“When we strive for the good or the beautiful, we forget our 
essence, which is differentiation, and we fall subject to the spell 
of the qualities of the Pleroma, which are the pairs of opposites. 
We endeavor to attain the good and the beautiful, yet at the same 
time we also seize the evil and the ugly, since in the Pleroma these 
are one with the good and the beautiful. But if we remain true to 
our essence, which is differentiation, we differentiate ourselves 
from the good and the beautiful, and hence from the evil and ugly. 
‘And thus we do not fall under the spell of the Pleroma, namely 
into nothingness and dissolution.** 

“You object: you said that difference and sameness are also 
«qualities of the Pleroma, What is it like if we strive for distinctive- 
ness? Are we, in so doing, not true to our own nature? And must we 
nonetheless fall into sameness when we strive for distinctiveness? 

“You must not forget that the Pleroma has no qualities 
We create these through thinking. If, therefore, you strive for 
distinctiveness or sameness, or any qualities whatsoever, you 
pursue thoughts that flow to you out of the Pleroma: thoughts, 
namely, concerning the non-existing qualities of the Pleroma. 
Inasmuch as you run after these thoughts, you fall again into the 
Pleroma, and attain distinctiveness and sameness atthe same time 
Not your thinking, but your essence, is differentiation. Therefore 
‘you must not strive for what you conceive as distinctiveness, but 
for your own esence. At bottom, therefore, there is only one striving, 
namely the striving for one’s own essence. If you had this striving, 
you would not need to know anything about the Pleroma and its 
qualities, and yet you would attain the right goal by virtue of your 
own essence. Since, however, thought alienates us from our 
essence, I must teach you that knowledge with which you can 
bridle your thoughts” 

"The dead faded away grumbling and moaning and their 
cries died away in the distance. 


"But I turned to @IAHMON and said, “My father, you utter 
strange teachings. Did not the ancients teach similar things? 
‘And was it not a reprehensible heresy, removed equally from 
ove and the truth? And why do you lay out such a teaching 
to this horde, which the night wind swirled up from the dark 
bloodfields of the West?” 

“My son,” @IAHMON replied, “these dead ended their lives too 
early. These were seekers and therefore still hover over their graves. 


Their lives were incomplete, since they knew no way beyond the 
one to which belief had abandoned them. But since no one teaches 
them, I must do so. That is what love demands, since they wanted 
to hear, even if they grumble, But why do I impart this teaching 
of the ancients? I teach in this way because their Christian faith 
once discarded and persecuted precisely this teaching. But they 
repudiated Christian belief and hence were rejected by that faith. 
They do not know this and therefore I must teach them, so that 
their life may be fulfilled and they can enter into death.” 
“But do you, Oh wise @AHMON, believe what you teach?” 
“My son,” @IAHMON replied, “why do you raise this question? 
How could I teach what I believe? Who would give me the right 
to such belief? Ieis what I know how to say, not because I believe 
it, but because I know it. If | knew better, I would teach better, 
But it would be easy for me to believe more. Yet should I teach a 
belief to those who have discarded belief? And, I ask you, is it good 
to believe something even more, if one does not know better?" 
“But” I retorted, “are you certain that things rally areas you say?” 
To this @AHMON answered, “I do not know whether it is the 
best that one can know. But I know nothing better and therefore 
I am certain these things are as I say. If they were otherwise I 
‘would say something else, since I would know them to be otherwise. 
But these things are as I know them, since my knowledge is precisely 
these things themselves.” 
“My father, is that your guarantee that you are not mistaken?” 
“There are no mistakes in these things,” @IAHMON replied, “there 
are only different levels of knowledge. These things are as you know 
them. Only in your world are things always other than you know 
them, and therefore there are only mistakes in your world,” 
“After these words IAHMON bent down and touched the earth 
with his hands and disappeared 


{7} That night @IAHMON stood beside me and the dead drew near 
and lined the walls and cried out,?° “We want to know about God. 
Where is God? Is God dead?"* 

Bur @1AHMON rose and said (and this is the second sermon 
to the dead): 


“God is not dead. He is as alive as ever. God is creation, for 
he is something definite, and therefore differentiated from the 
Pleroma. God is a quality of the Pleroma, and everything I have 
said about creation also applies to him. 

“But he is distinct from creation in that he is much more 
indefinite and indeterminable, He is less differentiated than 
creation, since the ground of his essence is effective fullness 
Only insofar as he is definite and differentiated is he creation, 
and as such he is the manifestation of the effective fullness of 
the Pleroma. 

“Everything that we do not differentiate falls into the Pleroma 
and is cancelled out by its opposite. If, therefore, we do not 
differentiate God, effective fullness is canceled out for us. 

“Moreover, God is the Pleroma itself just as each smallest 
point in the created and uncreated is the Pleroma itself.

“Effective emptiness is the essence of the devil, God and devil 
are the first manifestations of nothingness, which we call the 
Pleroma. It makes no difference whether the Pleroma exists or 
not, since it cancels itself out completely. Not so creation, Insofar 
as God and the devil are created beings, they do not cancel each 
other out, but stand one against the other as effective opposites. 
‘We need no proof of their existence. It is enough that we have to 
keep speaking about them, Even if both were not, creation would 
forever distinguish them anew out of the Pleroma on account of 
their distinct essences. 

“Everything that differentiation takes out of the Pleroma is a 
pair of opposites, therefore the devil always belongs to God.” 

“This inseparability is most intimate and, as you know from 
experience, as indissoluble in your life as the Pleroma itself since 
both stand very close to the Pleroma in which all opposites are 
canceled out and united. 

“Fullness and emptiness, generation and destruction, are what 
distinguish God and the devil. Effecrivenes is common to both. 
Effectiveness joins them. Effectiveness, therefore, stands above 
both, and is a God above God, since it unites fullness and emptiness 
through its effectuality 

“This is a God you knew nothing about, because mankind 
forgot him, We call him by his name ABRAXAS.” He is even more 
indefinite than God and the devil 

“To distinguish him from God, we call God HELIOS or sun.* 
Abraxas is effect. Nothing stands opposed to him but the 
ineffective; hence his effective nature unfolds itself freely. The 
ineffective neither exists nor resists. Abraxas stands above the 
sun and above the devil, He is improbable probability, that which 
takes unreal effect. Ifthe Pleroma had an essence, Abraxas would 
be its manifestation 

“He is the effectual itself, not any particular effect, but effect 
in general 

He takes unreal effect, because he has no definite effect 

He is also creation, since he is distinct from the Pleroma. 

The sun has a definite effect, and so does the devil. Therefore 
they appear to us more effective than the indefinite Abraxas, 

He is force, duration, change.” 


"The dead now raised a great tumult, for they were Christians. 


But when @IAHMON had ended his speech, one after 
another the dead also stepped back into the darkness once 
more and the noise of their outrage gradually died away in the 
distance. When all the clamor had passed, I turned to @1AHMQN 
and exclaimed: 

“Pity us, wisest one! You take from men the Gods to whom they 
could pray. You take alms from the beggar, bread from the hungry, 
fie from the freezing.” 

IAHMON answered and said, “My son, these dead have had to 
reject the belief of the Christians and therefore they can pray to 


SCRUTINIES | 349 


no God. So should I teach them a God in whom they can believe 
and to whom they can pray? That is precisely what they have 
rejected. Why did they reject it? They had to reject it because 
they could not do otherwise, And why did they have no other 
choice? Because the world, without these men knowing it, entered 
into that month of the great year where one should believe only 
what one knows. That is difficule enough, but i is also a remedy 
for the long sickness that arose from the fact that one believed 
what one did not know. I teach them the God whom both I and 
they know of without being aware of him, a God in whom one 
does not believe and to whom one does not pray, but of whom 
one knows. I teach this God to the dead since they desired entry 
and teaching. But I do not teach him to living men since they 
did not desire my teaching. Why, indeed, should I teach them? 
Therefore, I take away from them no kindly hearer of prayers, 
their father in Heaven. What concern is my foolishness to the 
living? The dead need salvation, since they are a great waiting 
flock hovering over their graves, and long for the knowledge that 
belief and the rejection of belief have breathed their last. But 
whoever has fallen ill and is near death wants knowledge, and he 
sacrifices pardon.” 

“It appears,” I replied, “as if you teach a terrible and dreadful 
God beyond measure, to whom good and evil and human suffering 
and joy are nothing.” 

“My son,” said @IAHMON, *Did you not see that these dead had a 
God of love and rejected him? Should I teach them a loving God? 
They had to reject him after already having long since rejected 
the evil God whom they call the devil, Therefore they must know 
God to whom everything created is nothing, because he himself 
is the creator and everything created and the destruction of 
everything created. Have they not rejected a God who is a father, 
a lover, good and beautiful? One whom they thought to have 
particular qualities and a particular being? Therefore I must teach 
a God to whom nothing can be attributed, who has all qualities and 
therefore none, because only I and they can know such a God.” 

“But how, Oh my father, can men unite in such a God? Does 
the knowledge of such a God not amount to destroying human 
bonds and every society based on the good and the beautiful?” 

IAHMON answered: “These dead rejected the God of love, 
of the good and the beautiful; they had to reject him and so 
they rejected unity and community in love, in the good and the 
beautiful, And thus they killed one another and dissolved the 
community of men, Should I teach them the God who united 
them in love and whom they rejected? Therefore I reach them 
the God who dissolves unity, who blasts everything human, who 
powerfully creates and mightily destroys. Those whom love 
does not unite, fear compels.” 

‘And as @IAHMON spoke these words, he bent down swiftly to 
the ground, touched it with his hand, and disappeared. 

{8} The following night,” the dead approached like fog from a 
swamp and exclaimed, “Tell us more about the highest God.”

‘And @IAHMON stepped forward and began to speak (and this 
is the third sermon to the dead)" 


“Abraxas is the God who is difficult to grasp. His power is 
greatest, because man does not see it. From the sun he draws 
the summun bonum;” from the devil the infinum malum; but from 
Abraxas LIFE, altogether indefinite, the mother of good and evil’= 

“Life seems to be smaller and weaker than the summum bonus, 
therefore itis also hard to conceive that Abraxas's power transcends 
even the sun's, which is the radiant source of all vital force. 

“Abraxas is the sun, and at the same time the eternally 
sucking gorge of emptiness, of che diminisher and dismemberer, 
of the devil. 

The power of Abraxas is twofold; but you do not see it, 
because in your eyes the warring opposites of this power are 
canceled out 

“What the Sun God speaks is life, what the devil speaks is death. 

“But Abraxas speaks that hallowed and accursed word that is 
at once life and death, 

“Abraxas produces truth and lying, good and evil, light and 
darkness, in the same word and in the same act. Therefore Abraxas 
is terrible. 

“Hie is as splendid as the lion in the instant he strikes down his 
victim, He is as beautiful as a spring day. 

“He is the great and the small Pan alike. 

“He is Priapos. 

“He is the monster of the underworld, a thousand-armed 
polyp, a coiled knot of winged serpents, frenzy. 

“He is the hermaphrodite of the earliest beginning. 

“He is the lord of toads and frogs, which live in the water 
and go up on the land, whose chorus ascends at noon and 
at midnight. 

“He is the fullness that seeks union with emptiness 

“He is holy begetting, 

“He is love and its murder, 

“He is the saint and his betrayer, 

“He is the brightest light of day and the darkest night of madness. 

“To look upon him, is blindness. 

“To recognize him is sickness. 

“To worship him is death. 

“To fear him is wisdom, 

"Not to resist him is redemption. 

“God dwells behind the sun, the devil behind the night. What 
God brings forth out of the light, the devil sucks into the night. 
But Abraxas is the world, its becoming and its passing. Upon every 
gift that comes from the sun god the devil lays his curse. 

“Everything that you request from the Sun God produces a 
deed from the devil. Everything that you create with the Sun 
God gives effective power to the devil

“That is terrible Abraxas, 

“He is the mightiest created being and in him creation is 
afraid of itself 

“He is the manifest opposition of creation to the Pleroma and 
its nothingness. 

“He is the son’s horror of the mother. 

He is the mother’s love for the son, 

He is the delight of the earth and the cruelty of the heavens. 

Athis sight man’s face congeals, 

Before him there is no question and no reply. 

He is the life of creation. 

He is the effect of differentiation, 

He is the love of man. 

He is the speech of man 

He is the appearance and the shadow of man. 

He is deceptive reality" 


"°Now the dead howled and raged, for they were incomplete 


But when their noisy cries had faded away, I said to @IAHMON: 
“How, Oh my father, should I understand this God?” 

@IAHMON answered and said: 

“My son, why do you want to understand him? This God is to 
be known but not understood. If you understand him, then you 
can say that he is this or that and this and not that, Thus you hold 
him in the hollow of your hand and therefore your hand must 
throw him away. The God whom I know is this and that and just 
as much this other and that other. Therefore no one can understand 
this God, but it is possible to know him, and therefore I speak 
and teach him.” 

“But, I retorted, “does this God not bring despairing confusion 
into the minds of men?” 

To this 1AHMON said, “These dead rejected the order of 
unity and community since they rejected the belief in the father 
in Heaven who ruled with just measure. They had to reject him. 
Therefore I teach them the chaos that is without measure and 
utterly boundless, to which justice and injustice, leniency and 
severity, patience and anger, love and hate, are nothing, For how 
can I teach anything other than the God whom I know and 
‘whom they know, without being conscious of him?” 

I replied, “Why, Oh solemn one, do you call the eternally 
incomprehensible, the cruel contradictoriness of nature, God?” 

@IAHMON said, “How should I name it otherwise? If the 
overpowering essence of events in the universe and in the hearts

Summum Bonum as being the source ofthe concept ofthe prints bor, which in hs view had led tothe denial ofthe reality of evil See Ate, 1951, CW 9, 2, §§80 and 94,

“Through studying che historical transform: 








sof God-images, he attempted to correct this (especially, Aan and Answer Jot). In his note on how Answer to Job came 

to be written he wrote that in Aion he had “criticized the idea of the privaio bri ae not agreeing with the psychological findings. Psychological experience shows us that 
whatever we call'good' is balanced by an equally substantial ‘bad’ or evil’ If‘eil is nonexistent. then whatever there is must needs be good.’ Dogmatcally, neither 
jgood’ nor evil can be derived from Man, since the ‘Evil One’ existed before Man as one of the'Sons of God. The idea ofthe privatio boni began to play a role in the 
Church only after Mani, Before chis heresy, Clement of Rome taught that God rules the world wich aright and a left hand, the right being Christ, the left being Satan. 
Clement’ view is cleasly monotheistic, a i unites the opposites in one God. Later Christianity however, is dualistic, inasmuch asi splits off one half ofthe opposites, 
personified in Satan... If Chestanity claims to be a mooteion, c becomes unavoidzble to assume the opposites as being contained in God" (1956, CW 1 pp. 357-58) 

rot In 1942, Jung noted “the concepe of an all-encompassing God must necesearily include hie opposite. The coincidence of course must not be too radial, otherwise 
‘God would cancel himself out. The principle of the coincidence of opposites must therefore be completed by its opposite in order to attain fll paradoxiclity and

and occurs as if from eternal law, and at another time a slanting 
wind blows a speck of dust into the works and this void is a 
superior strength, harder than a mountain of iron. Therefore you 
know that the eternal law is also no law. So I cannot call it law, 
But how else should it be named? I know that human language 
has forever named the maternal womb of the incomprehensible 
God. Truly, this God is and is nor, since from being and nonbeing 
everything emerged that was, is, and will be.” 

But when ®IAHMON had spoken the last word, he touched the 
earth with his hand and dissolved, 


{9} The following night, the dead came running sooner, filling 
the place with their mutterings, and said: 

“Speak to us about Gods and devils, accursed one.” 

And ®IAHMON appeared and began to speak (and this is the 
fourth sermon to the dead)" 


“The Sun God is the highest good, the devil the opposite. Thus 
you have two Gods. But there are many high and good things 
and many great evils. Among these are two devil Gods; one is the 
Burning One, the other the Growing One. 

‘The burning one is Eros, in the form of a fame. It shines by 
consuming" 

“The growing one is the TREE OF LIFE. It greens by heaping up 
growing living matter." 

“Eros flames up and dies. But the tree of life grows with slow 
and constant increase through measureless periods of time. 

“Good and evil unite in the flame. 

“Good and evil unite in the growth of the tree. In their divinity 
life and love stand opposed. 

“The number of Gods and devils is as innumerable as the host 
of stars 

“Each star is a God, and each space that a star fills isa devil. But 
the empty fullness of the whole is the Pleroma 

“Abraxas is the effect of the whole, and only the ineffective 
‘opposes him. 

“Four is the number of the principal Gods, as fouris the number 
of the world’s measurements, 

“One is the beginning, the Sun God, 

“Two is Eros, for he binds two together and spreads himself 
out in brightness 

“Three is the Tree of Life, for it fills space with bodies 

“Four is the devil, for he opens all that is closed. He dissolves 
everything formed and physical; he is the destroyer in whom 
everything becomes nothing

of the Gods. But woe unto you, who replace this incompatible 
multiplicity with a single God. In so doing you produce the

torment of incomprehension, and mutilate the creation whose 
nature and aim is differentiation. How can you be true to your own 
nature when you try to turn the many into one? What you do unto 
the Gods is done likewise unto you. You all become equal and thus 
your nature" is maimed. 

“Equality prevails not for the sake of God, but only for the sake 
of man, For the Gods are many, while men are few. The Gods are 
mighty and endure their manifoldness. Like the stars they abide 
in solitude, separated by vast distances. Therefore they dwell 
together and need communion, so that they may bear their 
separateness,*” For redemption’s sake I teach you the reprehensible, 
for whose sake I was rejected. 

“The multiplicity of the Gods corresponds to the multiplicity 
of men. 

“Numberless Gods await the human state. Numberless Gods 
have been men. Man shares in the nature of the Gods. He comes 
from the Gods and goes unto the God. 

“Thus, just as itis no use to reflect upon the Pleroma, itis not 
worthwhile to worship the multiplicity of the Gods. Least of all 
does it serve to worship the first God, the effective fullness, and 
the summum bonum. By our prayer we can add nothing to it, and 
take nothing from it; because effective emptiness gulps down 
everything. The bright Gods form the heavenly world. It is 
manifold and extends and increases infinitely. The Sun God is the 
supreme lord of the world. 

“The dark Gods form the earthly world. It is simple and 
diminishes and declines infinitely. The devil is its nethermost 
lord, the moon spirit, satelite of the earth, smaller, colder, and 
more dead than the earth 

“There is no difference between the might of the heavenly 
and earthly Gods. The heavenly Gods magnify, the earthly Gods 
diminish, Both directions are immeasurable.” 

‘Here the dead interrupted ®IAHMAN’s speech with angry 
laughter and mocking shouts, and as they withdrew, their 
discord, mockery, and laughter faded into the distance. I turned

“Oh GIAHMON, I believe you are mistaken, It seems that you 
teach a raw superstition which the Fathers had successfully and 
gloriously overcome, that polytheism which a mind produces only 
‘when it cannot free its gaze from the force of compulsive desire 
chained to sensory things.” 

“My son,” @IAHMON replied, “these dead have rejected the 
single and highest God, So how can I teach them about the one, 
only, and not multifarious God? They must of course believe me. 
But they have rejected their belief. So I teach them the God that 
T know; the multifarious and extended, who is both the thing and 
its appearance, and they also know him even if they are not 
conscious of him.

“These dead have given names to all beings, the beings in the 
air, on the earth and in the water. They have weighed and counted 
things. They have counted so and so many horses, cows, sheep, 
trees, segments of land, and springs; they said, this is good for 
this purpose, and that is good for that one. What did they do 
with the admirable tree? What happened to the sacred frog? 
Did they see his golden eye? Where is the atonement for the 
7777 cattle whose blood they spilled, whose flesh they consumed? 
Did they do penance for the sacred ore that they dug up from 
the belly of the earth? No, they named, weighed, numbered, and 
apportioned all things. They did whatever pleased them. And 
what did they do! You saw the powerful—but this is precisely 
how they gave power to things unknowingly. Yet the time has 
‘come when things speak. The piece of flesh says: how many men? 
“The piece of ore says, how many men? The ship says, how many 
men? The coal says, how many men? The house says: how many 
men? And things rise and number and weigh and apportion and 
devour millions of men. 

“Your hand grasped the earth and tore off the halo and weighed 
and numbered the bones of things. Is not the one and only, 
simpleminded God pulled down and thrown onto a heap, the 
massed seeming of separate things dead and living? Yes, this 
God taught you to weigh and number bones. But the month of 
this God is drawing to a close. A new month stands at the door. 
Therefore everything had to be as itis, and hence everything must 
become different. 

“This is no polytheism that I have made up! But many Gods 
who powerfully raise their voices and tear humanity to bloody 
pieces. So and so many men, weighed, numbered, apportioned, 
hacked, and devoured. Therefore I speak of many Gods as I speak 
of many things, since I know them. Why do I call them Gods? 
For the sake of their superiority, Do you know about this superior 
strength? Now is the time when you can learn. 

“These dead laugh at my foolishness. But would they have raised 
a murderous hand against their brothers if they had atoned for 
the ox with the velvet eyes? If they had done penance for the 
shiny ore? If they had worshiped the holy trees? If they had 
made peace with the soul of the golden-eyed frog? What say 
things dead and living? Who is greater, man or the Gods? Truly, 
this sun has become a moon and no new sun has arisen from the 
contractions of the last hour of the night.” 

‘And when he had finished these words, ®1AHMON bent down 
to the earth, kissed it, and said, “Mother, may your son be strong” 
Then he stood, looked up at the heavens, and said, “How darke is 
your place of the new light.” Then he disappeared. 


fro} When the following night came, the dead approached 
noisily, pushing and shoving, they were scoffing and exclaimed, 
“Teach us, fool, about the church and holy communion.” 

But ®IAHMON stepped before them, and began to speak" 
(and this is the fifth sermon to the dead) 

“The world of the Gods is made manifest in spirituality and 
in sexuality. The celestial ones appear in spirituality, the earthly 
in sexuality. 


“Spirituality conceives and embraces. It is womanlike and 
therefore we call it marer CosLesTis," the celestial mother, 
Sexuality engenders and creates, It is manlike, and therefore we 
call it p1zatt0s." the earthly father." The sexuality of man is more 
earthly, that of woman is more spiritual. The spirituality of man 
is more heavenly, it moves toward the greater. 

“The spirituality of woman is more earthly, it moves toward 
the smaller. 

“Mendacious and devilish is the spisituality of man, and it 
moves toward the smaller. 

“Mendacious and devilish is the spirituality of woman, and it 
moves toward the greater. 

“Each shall go to its own place. 

“Man and woman become devils to each other if they do 
not separate their spiritual ways, for the essence of ereation 
is differentiation. 

“The sexuality of man goes toward the earthly, the sexuality 
of woman goes toward the spiritual. Man and woman become 
devils to each other if they do not distinguish their sexuality 

“Man shall know the smaller, woman the greater. 

“Man shall differentiate himself both from spirituality and 
sexuality. He shall call spirituality mother, and set her between 
Heaven and earth. He shall call sexuality Phallos, and set him 
between himself and earth, For the mother and the Phallos are 
superhuman daimons that reveal the world of the Gods. They 
affect us more than the Gods since they are closely akin to our 
essence." If you do not differentiate yourselves from sexuality 
and from spirituality, and do not regard them as an essence both 
above and beyond you, you are delivered over to them as qualities 
of the Pleroma, Spirituality and sexuality are not your qualities, 
not things you possess and encompass. Rather, they possess and 
encompass you, since they are powerful daimons, manifestations 
of the Gods, and hence reach beyond you, existing in themselves. 
No man has a spirituality unto himself, or a sexuality unto himself, 
Instead, he stands under the law of spirituality and of sexuality. 
Therefore no one escapes these daimons. You shall look upon 
them as daimons, and as a common task and danger, a common 
burden that life has laid upon you, Thus life, too, is for you a 
common task and danger, as are the Gods, and first and foremost 
terrible Abraxas, 

“Man is weak, and community is therefore indispensable. If your 
community is not under the sign of the mother, it is under the sign 
of the Phallos. Absence of community is suffering and sickness. 
Community in everything is dismemberment and dissolution, 

“Differentiation leads to singleness. Singleness is opposed 
to community. But because of man’s weakness with regard to 
the Gods and daimons and their invincible law, community 
is necessary, not for man’s sake, but because of the Gods. The 
Gods drive you to community, Insofar as the Gods impose 
community upon you, it is necessary; more is bad. 

“In the community every man shall submit to others, so that 
the community be maintained, for you need it. 

“In singleness every man shall place himself above the other, so 
that every man may come to himself and avoid slavery. 


110 This may refer to the advent of Christianity into Germany in the eighth century CE, when sacred trees were chopped down.

{r1}When @IAHMON had finished, the dead remained silent 
and did not move, but looked at 6LAHMON with expectation. But 
when ®IAHMON saw that the dead remained silent and waited, he 
continued (and this is the sixth sermon to the dead)" 


“The daimon of sexuality approaches our soul as a serpent. She 
is half human soul and is called thought-desire. 

“The daimon of spirituality descends into our soul as the 
white bird. He is half human soul and is called desire-thought. 

‘The serpent is an earthly soul, half daimonic, a spirit, and 
akin to the spirits of the dead. Thus too, like these she swarms 
around in the things of earth, making us fear them or else having 
them arouse our craving. The serpent has a female nature, forever 
seeking the company of those dead who are spellbound by the 
earth, and who did not find a way across to singleness. The 
serpent is a whore. She courts the devil and evil spirits; she is a 
mischievous tyrant and tormentor, forever inveigling the most 
evil company. The white bid is a half-celestial soul of man, He 
abides with the mother, descending from time to time. The bird 
is manlike, and is effective thought. He is chaste and solitary, 
a messenger of the mother. He flies high above the earth. He 
commands singleness. He brings knowledge from the distant 
ones, who have departed before and attained perfection. He 
bears our word up to the mother. She intercedes, she warns, but 
she is powerless against the Gods, She is a vessel of the sun. The 
serpent descends and cunningly lames the phallic daimon, or 
else goads him on. She bears up the too-crafty thoughts of the 
earthly, those thoughts that creep through every hole and cleave 
toall things with craving. Although the serpent does not want to, 
she must be of use to us. She flees our grasp, thus showing us the 
way, which our human wits could not find.” 


“When ®IAHMON had finished, the dead looked on with, 
contempt and said, “Cease this talk of Gods and daimons and 
souls, We have known this for a long time.” 

But @IAHMON smiled and replied, “You poor souls, poor in 
flesh and rich in spirit, the meat was fat and the spirit thin. But 
how do you reach the eternal light? You mock my stupidity, which 
you too possess: you mock yourselves. Knowledge frees one from 
danger. But mockery is the other side of your belief. Is black less 
than white? You rejected faith and retained mockery. Are you 
thus saved from faith? No, you bound yourselves to mockery and 
hence again to faith. And therefore you are miserable.” 

But the dead were outraged and cried, “We are not miserable, 
we are clever; our thinking and feeling is as pure as clear water. 
‘We praise our reason, We mock superstition. Do you believe that 
your old folly reaches us? A childish delusion has overcome you, 
old one, what good is it to us?” 

IAHMON replied: “What can do you any good? I free you 
from what still holds you to the shadow of life. Take this

wisdom with you, add this folly to your cleverness, this unreason 
to your reason, and you will find yourselves. If you were men, you 
would then begin your life and your life's way between reason 
and unreason and live onward to the eternal light, whose shadow 
you lived in advance. But since you are dead, this knowledge frees 
you from life and strips you of your greed for men and it also 
frees your self from the shrouds that the light and the shadow 
lay on you, compassion with men will overcome you and from 
the stream you will reach solid ground, you will step forth from 
the eternal whirl onto the unmoving stone of rest, the circle that 
breaks flowing duration, and the flame will die down. 

“I have fanned a glowing fire, I have given the murderer a 
knife, [ have torn open healed-over wounds, I have quickened all 
movement, I have given the madman more intoxicating drink, 
T have made the cold colder, the heat hotter, falseness even 
falser, goodness even better, weakness even weaker, 

“This knowledge is the axe of the sacrificer.” 

But the dead cried, “Your wisdom is foolishness and a curse. You 
want to turn the wheel back? It will tear you apart, blinded one!” 

@IAHMON replied, “So this is what happened. The earth 
became green and fruitful again from the blood of the sacrifice, 
flowers sprouted, the waves crash into the sand, a silver cloud lies 
at the foot of the mountain, a bird of the soul came to men, the 
hoe sounds in the fields and the axe in the forests, a wind rushes 
through the trees and the sun shimmers in the dew of the risen 
morning, the planets behold the birth, out of the earth climbed 
the many-armed, the stones speak and the grass whispers 
Man found himself, and the Gods wander through Heaven, the 
fullness gives birth to the golden drop, the golden seed, plumed 
and hovering.” 

The dead now fell silent and stared at @IAHMON and slowly 
crept away, But @IAHMON bent down to the ground and said: “It 
is accomplished, but not fulfilled. Fruit of the earth, sprout, rise 
up~and Heaven, pour out the water of life.” 

Then ®1AHMON disappeared. 


=] was probably very confused when @IAHMON approached 
‘me the following night, since I called to him saying, “What 
did you do, Oh @IAHMON? What fires have you kindled? 
‘What have you broken asunder? Does the wheel of creations 
stand still?” 

But he answered and said, “Everything is running its usual 
course, Nothing has happened, and yet a sweet and indescribable 
mystery has taken place: I stepped out of the whirling circle.” 

“What's that?” I exclaimed, “Your words move my lips, your 
voice sounds from my ears, my eyes see you from within me. Truly, 
you are a magician! You stepped out of the whirling circle? What 
confusion! Are you I, am I you? Did I not feel as if the wheel of 
creation was standing still? And yet you say that you have stepped 
out of the whirling circle? I am truly bound to the wheel—I feel 
the rushing swaying of it—and yet the wheel of creation also 
stands still for me, What did you do, father, teach me!” 

“Then @1AHMON said, “I stepped onto what is solid and took it 
‘with me and saved it from the wave surge, from the cycle of births, 
and from the revolving wheel of endless happening, It has been 
stilled. The dead have received the folly of the teaching, they have

and regretted it; they will come again and will humbly inquire. 
Since what they rejected will be most valuable to them.” 

I wanted to question @1AHMQN, since the riddle distressed 
me. But he had already touched the earth and disappeared. And 
the darkness of the night was silent and did not answer me. And 
my soul stood silently, shaking her head, and did not know what 
to say about the mystery that @IAHMON had indicated and not 
given away. 


{12} Another day passed and the seventh night fel. 

And the dead came again, this time with pitiful gestures and 
said, “We forgot to mention one thing, that we would like you to 
teach us about men.” 

‘And @1AHMON stepped before me, and began to speak™ (and 
this is the seventh sermon to the dead)” 


“Man is a gateway, through which you pass from the outer 
world of Gods, daimons, and souls into the inner world, out of 
the greater into the smaller world, Small and inane is man, already 
he is behind you, and once again you find yourselves in endless 
space, in the smaller or inner infinity. 

“At immeasurable distance a lonely star stands in the zenith, 

“This is the one God of this one man, this is his world, his 
Pleroma, his divinity. 

“In this world, man is Abraxas, the creator and destroyer of his, 
own world. 

“This star is the God and the goal of man. 

This is his one guiding God, 

in him man goes to his rest, 

toward him goes the long journey of the soul after death, 

in him everything that man withdraws from the greater world 
shines resplendently. 

“To this one God man shall pray. 

Prayer increases the light of the star, 

it throws a bridge across death, 

it prepares life for the smaller world, and assuages the hopeless 
desires of the greater. 

“When the greater world turns cold, the star shines. 

“Nothing stands between man and his one God, so long as man, 
can turn away his eyes from the flaming spectacle of Abraxas 

“Man here, God there.

"But when @IAHMON had finished, the dead remained silent. 
Heaviness fell from them, and they ascended like smoke above 
the shepherd's fire, who watches over his flock by night. 


Bur I turned to @1AHMON and said, “Illustrious one, you teach 
that man is a gateway? A gateway through which the procession of 
the Gods passes? Through which the stream of life lows? Through 
which the entire furure streams into the endlessness of the past?” 

IAHMON answered, saying, “These dead believed in the 
transformation and development of man. They were convinced 
of human nothingness and transitoriness. Nothing was clearer 
to them than this, and yet they knew that man even creates its 
Gods, and so they knew that the Gods were of no use. Therefore 
they had to learn what they did not know, that man is a gateway 
through which crowds the train of the Gods and the coming and 
passing of all times. He does not do it, does not create it, does 
not suffer it, since he is the being, the sole being, since he is the 
moment of the world, the eternal moment. Whoever recognizes 
this stops being flame; he becomes smoke and ashes. He lasts 
and his transitoriness is over. He has become someone who is. 
‘You dreamed of the flame, as if it were life, But life is duration, 
the flame dies away. I carried that over, I saved it from the fire. 
“That is the son of the fire flower. You saw that in me, I myself 
am of the eternal fire of light. But I am the one who saved it for 
you, the black and golden seed and its blue starlight. You eternal 
being—what is length and brevity? What is the moment and 
eternal duration? You, being, are eternal in each moment. What 
is time? Time is the fire that flares up, consumes, and dies down, 
1 saved being from time, redeeming it from the fires of time and 
the darkness of time, from Gods and devils.” 

But I said to him, “Illustrious one, when will you give me the 
dark and golden treasure and its blue starlight?” 

IAHMON replied, “When you have surrendered everything 
that wants to burn to the holy flame."™* 

{13} And as @IAHMON spoke these words, a dark form with 
golden eyes approached me from the shadows of the night." I 
‘was startled and cried, “Are you an enemy? Who are you? Where 
do you come from? I have never seen you before! Speak, what do 
you want?”

‘The dark one answered, saying, “I come from afar. I come from 
the east and follow the shining fire that precedes me, @IAHMON. 
Tam not your enemy, I am a stranger to you. My skin is dark and 
my eyes shine golden.” 

“What do you bring?” I asked fearfully. 

“I bring abstinence—abstinence from human joy and suffering, 
Compassion leads to alienation. Pity, but no compassion—pity 
for the world and a will held in check toward the other. 

Pity remains misunderstood, therefore it works. 

Far from longing, know no feat. 

Far from love, love the whole.” 

looked at him fearfully and said, “Why are you as dark as the 
earth of the fields and as black as iron? I'm afraid of you; such 
pain, what have you done to me?” 

“You may call me death—death that rose with the sun. I come 
with quiet pain and long peace. I lay the cover of protection on 
you. In the midst of life begins death. I lay cover upon cover 
upon you so that your warmth will never cease.” 

“You bring grief and despair,” I answered, “I wanted to be 
among men. 

But he said, “You will go to men as one veiled. Your light shines 
at night. Your solar nature departs from you and your stellar 
nature begins.” 

“You are cruel,” I sighed, 

“The simple is cruel, it does not unite with the manifold” 

With these words the mysterious dark one vanished. But 
®IAHMON regarded me with a serious and questioning look 
“Did you take a proper look at him, my son?” he said, “you will 
be hearing from him. But come now, so that I can fulfill what the 
dark one prophesied for you.” 

As he spoke these words, he touched my eyes and opened my 
gaze and showed me the immeasurable mystery. And I looked for 
along time until I could grasp it: but what did I see? I saw the 
night, I saw the dark earth, and above this the sky stood gleaming 
in the brilliance of countless stars. And I saw that the sky had the 
form of a woman and sevenfold was her mantle of stars and it 
completely covered her. 

And when I had beheld it, O1AHMON said: 

"Mother, you who stand in the higher circle, nameless one, 
who shrouds me and him and protects me and him from the Gods 
he wants to become your child 

“May you accept his birth, 

“May you renew him. I separate myself from him." The cold 
is growing and its star blazes brighter. 

“Hie needs the bond of childhood. 

“You gave birth to the godly serpent, you released it from the 
pangs of birth; take this man to the abode of the sun, he needs 
the mother.”

‘A voice came from afar” and was like a falling star: 

“I cannot take him as a child, He must cleanse himself first.” 

IAHMON said,” “What is his impurity?” 

Bur the voice said, “It is the commingling: he contains human 
suffering and joy, He shall remain secluded until abstinence is 
complete and he is freed from the commingling with men, Then 
shall he be taken as a child.” 

In this moment my vision ended. And ®IAHMON went away 
and I was alone. And I remained apart as I had been told, But 
in the fourth night I saw a strange form, a man wearing a long 
coat and a turban; his eyes shone cleverly and kindly like a wise 
doctor's.” He approached me and said, “I speak to you of joy” But 
1 answered, “You want to speak to me of joy? I bleed from the 
thousandfold wounds of men.” 

He replied, “I bring healing. Women taught me this art. They 
know how to heal sick children, Do your wounds burn you? Healing 
is at hand, Give ear to good counsel and do not be incensed.” 

1 retorted, “What do you want? To tempt me? Mock me?” 

“What are you thinking?” he interrupted, “I bring you the bliss 
of paradise, the healing fire, the love of women.” 

“Are you thinking” I asked, “ofthe descent into the frog swamp?” 
‘The dissolution in the many, the scattering, the dismembering?” 

But as I spoke, the old man turned into @IAHMQN,” and 
I saw that he was the magician who was tempting me. But 
®IAHMON continued: 

“You have not yet experienced the dismembering. You should 
be blown apart and shredded and scattered to the winds. Men are 
preparing for the Last Supper with you.” 

“What then will remain of me?” I cried. 

“Nothing but your shadow. You will be a river that pours 
forth over the lands. It seeks every valley and streams toward 
the depths.” 

1 asked, full of grief, “But where will my uniqueness remain?” 

“You will steal it from yourself.” @IAHMON replied,” “You 
will hold the invisible realm in trembling hands; it lowers its 
roots into the gray darknesses and mysteries of the earth and 
sends up branches covered in leaves into the golden air. 

“Animals live in its branches. 

“Men camp in its shade. 

“Their murmuring arises from below. 

“A thousand-mile-long disappointment is the juice of the tree. 

“Te will stay green for a long time. 

“Silence abides in its treetop. 

“Silence in its deep roots.” 

1 gathered from @IAHMON’s words that I must remain true 
to love to cancel out the commingling that arises through unlived 
love. I understood that the commingling is a bondage that takes 
the place of voluntary devotion. Scattering or dismembering arises,

as OIAHMON had taught me, from voluntary devotion. Ie cancels 
‘out the commingling. Through voluntary devotion I removed 
binding ties. Therefore I had to remain true to love, and, devoted 
to it voluntarily I suffer the dismembering and thus attain bonding 
with the great mother, that is, the stellar nature, liberation from 
bondage to men and things. If I am bound to men and things, I 
can neither go on with my life to its destination nor can I arrive at 
my very own and deepest nature. Nor can death begin in me as a 
new life, since I can only fear death. I must therefore remain true 
to love since how else can I arrive at the scattering and dissolution 
of bondage? How else could I experience death other than through 
remaining true to love and willingly accepting the pain and all che 
suffering? As long as I do not voluntarily devote myself to the 
dismembering, a part of my self secretly remains with men and 
things and binds me to them; and thus I must, whether I want 
to oF not, be a part of them, mixed in with them and bound to 
them, Only fidelity to love and voluntary devotion to love enable 
this binding and mixing to be dissolved and lead back to me that 
part of my self that secretly lay with men and things. Only thus 
does the light of the star grow, only thus do I arrive at my stellar 
nature, at my truest and innermost self, chat simply and singly is. 

Itis difficult to remain true to love since love stands above 
all sins. He who wants to remain true to love must also overcome 
sin. Nothing occurs more readily than failing to recognize 
that one is committing a sin. Overcoming sin for the sake 
of remaining true to love is difficult, so difficult that my feet 
hesitated to advance. 

‘When night fell, TAHMON approached me in an earth-colored 
robe, holding a silver fish: “Look, my son.” he said, “I was fishing 
and caught this fish; I bring itto you, so that you maybe comforted.” 
‘And as I looked at him astonished and questioningly, I saw that a 
shade stood in darkness at the door, bearing a robe of grandeur.” 
His face was pale and blood had flowed into the furrows of his 
brow. Bur @IAHMON knelt down, touched the earth, and said to 
the shade, “My master and my brother, praised be your name. 
You did the greatest thing for us: out of animals you made men, 
you gave your life for men to enable their healing. Your spirit was, 
with us through an endlessly long time. And men still look to 
you and still ask you to take pity on them and beg for the mercy 
of God and the forgiveness of their sins through you. You do 
not tire of giving to men. I praise your divine patience. Are not 
men ungrateful? Does their craving know no limits? Do they still 
make demands on you? They have received so much yer still they 
are beggars. 

“Behold, my master and my brother, they do not love me, but 
they long for you with greed, for they also crave their neighbor's 
possessions. They do not love their neighbor, but they want 
what is his. If they were faithful to their love, they would not be 
greedy. But whoever gives, attracts desire. Should they not learn 
love? Fidelity to love? Freely willed devotion? But they demand 
and desire and beg from you and have learned no lesson from 
your awe-inspiring life. They have imitated it, but they have not 
lived their own lives as you have lived yours, Your awe-inspiring 
life shows how everyone would have to take their own life into 
their own hands, faithful to their own essence and their own 
love, Have you not forgiven the adulteress2” Did you not sit with

whores and tax-collectors?“° Did you not break the command 
of the Sabbath? You lived your own life, but men fail to do so; 
instead they pray to you and make demands on you and forever 
remind you that your work is incomplete. Yet your work would 
be completed iff men managed to live their own lives without 
imitation. Men are still childish and forget gratitude, since they 
cannot say, Thanks be to you, our lord, for the salvation you have 
brought us, We have taken it unto ourselves, given ita place in our 
hearts, and we have learned to carry on your work in ourselves on, 
our own. Through your help we have grown mature in continuing 
the work of redemption in us. Thanks to you, we have embraced 
your work, we grasped your redemptive teaching, we completed 
in ourselves what you had begun for us with bloody struggle. We 
are not ungrateful children who desire our parents’ possessions. 
Thanks to you, our master, we will make the most of your talent 
and will not bury it in the earth and forever stretch out our 
hands helplessly and urge you to complete your work in us. We 
want to take your troubles and your work upon ourselves so that 
your work may be completed and so that you may lay your weary 
tired hands in your lap, like the worker after a long day's hard 
burden, Blessed is the dead one, who rests from the completion 
of his work. 

“L wanted people to address you in this way. But they have no 
love for you, my master and brother. They begrudge you the price 
of peace. They leave your work incomplete, eternally needing 
your pity and your care. 

“But, my master and my brother, I believe you have completed 
your work, since the one who has given his life, his entire truth, 
all his love, his entire soul, has completed his work. What one 
individual can do for men, you have done and accomplished 
and fulfilled. The time has come when each must do his own 
‘work of redemption, Mankind has grown older and a new month 
has begun.” 

“When @IAHMON had finished, I looked up and saw that the 
place where the shade had stood was empty. I turned to @INHMON 
and said, “My father, you spoke of men, [am a man, Forgive me!” 

But @1AHMON dissolved into the darkness and I decided to do 
what was required of me. I accepted all the joy and every torment 
of my nature and remained true to my love, to suffer what comes to 
everyone in their own way. And I stood alone and was afraid 


{14} On a night when everything was silent, I heard a murmur 
like that of many voices and a bit more clearly I heard the voice 
of OIAHMON, and it was as if he were giving a speech, And as I 
listened more closely, I heard his words: 

“Afterward, when I had impregnated the dead body of the 
underworld, and when it had given birth to the serpent of the 
God, I went to men and saw the fullness of their affliction and 
their madness, I saw that they were slaying each other and that 
they sought the grounds for their actions. They did this because 
they did not have anything different or better to do. But because 
they were accustomed to doing nothing for which they could 
not account, they devised reasons that compelled them to go on 
killing, Stop, you are out of your minds, said the sage, Stop, for 
Heaven's sake, and take stock of what damage you have done, 
said the canny one. But the fool laughed, since honors had

been conferred upon him overnight. Why do men not see their 
stupidity? Stupidity is a daughter of the God. Therefore men 
cannot stop murdering, since thus they serve the serpent of the 
God without knowing it. It is worth giving one’s life for the sake 
of serving the serpent of the God, Hence be reconciled! But it 
would be far better to live despite the God. But the serpent of 
the God wants human blood. This feeds it and makes it shine. 
Not wanting to murder and die amounts to deceiving the God. 
Whoever lives has become one who deceives the God. Whoever 
lives invents his life for himself, But the serpent wants to be 
deceived, out of hope for blood. The greater the number of 
men who stole their lives from the Gods, the greater the harvest 
feeding the serpent from the blood-sown field. The God grows 
strong through human murder. The serpent grows hot and fiery 
through the drenching flood. Its fat burns in the blazing flame 
The flame becomes the light of men, the first ray of a renewed 
sun, He, the first appearing light.” 

T could not grasp what else SIAHMON said, I spent a long 
time pondering his words, which evidently he had spoken to 
the dead, and I was horrified by the atrocities that attend the 
rebirth of a God. 

“And soon afterward I saw Elijah and Salome in a dream 
Elijah appeared concerned and alarmed. Therefore, when in 
the following night that light was extinguished and every living 
sound fell still, I called Elijah and Salome so that they would 
answer my questions. Elijah came forward and said: 

“Thave become weak, I am poor, an excess of my power has gone 
to you, my son. You took too much from me, You went too far 
away from me, I heard strange and incomprehensible things and 
the peace of my depths became disturbed.” 

T asked, “But what did you hear? What voice did you hear?” 

Elijah answered, “I heard a voice full of confusion, an alarmed 
voice full of warning and the incomprehensible.” 

“What did it say” I asked, “did you hear the words?” 

“Indistinctly, it was confused and confusing, The voice spoke 
first of a knife cutting something or perhaps harvesting, perhaps 
the grapes that go to the wine press, Perhaps the one wearing 
the red robe treads the winepress from which the blood flows." 
‘Thereupon the voice spoke of gold that lies below, and that kills 
whoever touches it. Then it mentioned fire chat burns terribly 
and that should flare up in our time. And then there was a malicious 
word, that I would rather not utter.” 

“A malicious word? What was it?” I asked. 

He answered, “A word about the death of God. There is only 
one God and God cannot die.”*” 

Then I replied, “I am astonished, Elijah. Do you not know 
what happened? Do you not know that the world has put on a 
new garb? That the one God has gone away, and that in turn 
many Gods and many daimons have come to man? Truly, [am 
surprised; 1 am extremely surprised! How could you not have 
known? Know you nothing of the new that has come to pass? Yet 
you know the future! You have foresight! Or maybe you should 
not know what is? Do you ultimately deny what is?”™"

Salome interrupted me: “What is, gives no pleasure. Pleasure 
comes only from the nev: Your soul would also like a new 
husband—ha ha!—she loves change. You are not pleasurable 
enough for her. In that respect she is unteachable and therefore 
you believe she is mad. We love only what is coming, not what 
is. Only the new gives us pleasure. Elijah does not think about 
what is, only about what is to come. Therefore he knows it.” 

1 answered, “What does he know? He should say” 

Elijah said, “I have already uttered the words: the image that 
1 saw was crimson, fiery colored, a gleaming gold. The voice that 
I heard was like distant thunder, like the wind roaring in the 
forest, like an earthquake. It was not the voice of my God, but it 
wwas a thunderous pagan roar, acall my ancestors knew but which 
Thave never heard, It sounded prehistoric, as if from a forest on 
a distant coast; it rang with all the voices of the wilderness. It 
was full of horror yet harmonic.” 

To this I replied, “My good old man, you heard correctly, as 1 
thought you had. How wonderful! Shall I tell you about it? After 
all, I told you that the world has acquired a new face. A new cover 
‘was thrown over it. How odd that you don’t know! 

“Old Gods have become new. The one God is dead~yes, truly, 
he died. He disintegrated into the many, and thus the world became 
rich overnight. And something also happened to the individual 
soul—who would care to describe it! But therefore men too became 
rich overnight. How is it possible that you didn’t know this? 

“The one God became two, a multiple one, whose body consists 
of many Gods, and a single one, whose body is a man and yet he is 
brighter and stronger than the sun. 

“What shall I tell you about the soul? Haven't you noticed 
that she has become multiple? She has become the closest, near- 
est, near, far, further, furthest and yet she is one, as before. First 
she divided herself into a serpent and a bird, then into a father 
and mother, and then into Elijah and Salome—How are you, my 
{good fellow? Does it disturb you? Yes, you must be realizing that 
you are already very far removed from me, so that I can hardly 
reckon you as being part of my soul; since if you belonged to 
my soul, you would have to know what is happening. Therefore 
I must separate you and Salome from my soul and place you 
among the daimons, You are connected to what is primordially 
old and always exists, therefore you also know nothing of the 
being of men but simply of the past and future. 

“Nevertheless it is good that you came to my call. Take part in 
that which is, For what is ought to be such that you can take part 
in it” 

But Elijah sullenty replied, 
not easy to think it.” 

‘And Salome said, “The simple alone is pleasurable, One need 
not think about it. * 

1 replied, “Elijah, you need not contemplate it at all. Ieis not to 
be thought; it isto be viewed. It is a painting” 

And to Salome I said, “Salome, itis not true that only the simple 
is pleasurable; over time it is even boring. In truth the multiple 
captivates you.”

But Salome turned to Elijah and said, “Father, it seems to me that 
men have outstripped us. He is sight: the many is more pleasurable. 
‘The one is too simple and always the same.” 

Elijah seemed saddened and said, "What about the one in this 
case? Does the one still exist if it stands next to the many?” 

T answered, “That is your old and ingrained mistake, that the 
one excludes the many. But there are many individual things. The 
multiplicity of individual things is the one multiple God from 
whose body many Gods atise, but the uniqueness of the one thing 
is the other God, whose body is a man but whose spirit is as large 
as the world.” 

But Elijah shook his head and said, “That is new, my son. Is the 
new good? What was, is good; and what was, willbe. Is that not the 
truth? Has there ever been anything new? And was what you call 
new, ever good? Everything remains the same if you give it a new 
name. There is nothing new, there can be nothing new; how could 
1 then look ahead? I look at the past and therein I see the future, 
as in a mirror. And I see that nothing new happens, everything is 
but mere recurrence of what has been since time immemorial." 
‘What is your being? An appearance, a darting light; tomorrow it 
is no longer true. It is gone; it is as if it never was. Come, Salome, 
let us go. One is mistaken in the world of men.” 

But Salome looked back and whispered to me while leaving, 
“Being and multiplicity appeal to me, even ifit is not new and not 
eternally true.” 

Thus they disappeared into the dark night and I returned to 
the burden signified by my existence. And I sought to do every- 
thing correctly that seemed to me to be a task and to take every 
way that seemed to me to be necessary for myself. But my dreams 
became difficult and laden with anxiety, and I did not know why: 
One night my soul suddenly came to me, as if worried, and said," 
“Listen to me: I am in a great torment, the son of the dark womb 
besieges me, Therefore your dreams are also difficult, since you 
feel the torment of the depths, the pain of your soul, and the 
suffering of the Gods.” 

I answered, “Can I help? Or is it superfluous that a man 
elevates himself to being a mediator of the Gods? Is it presumption 
or should a man become a redeemer of the Gods, after men are 
saved through the divine mediator?” 

“You speak the truth,” my soul replied, “the Gods need a human 
mediator and rescuer. With this man paves the way to crossing 
over and to divinity. I gave you a frightening dream so that your 
face would turn to the Gods. I let their torment reach you so that 
you would remember the suffering Gods. You do too much for 
‘men since they are the masters of your world, You can in effect 
help men only through the Gods, not directly. Alleviate the burning 
torment of the Gods.” 

asked her, “So tell me, where do I begin? I feel their torment and 
mine at the same time, and yet itis not mine, both real and unreal.” 

“That is it; and this is where separation should occur,” my 
soul replied 

“But how? My wits fail me, You must know how” 

“Your wits fail quickly.” she retorted, “but the Gods need 
precisely your human wits 

"And I the wits of the Gods.” I added; “and thus we run aground.” 

“No, you are too impatient; only patient comparison provides a 
solution, not one side taking a quick decision, It requires work.” 

1 asked, “What do the Gods suffer from?” 

“Well,” my soul replied, “you have lefe them with torment, and 
since then they have suffered.”

“Rightly so,” I cried, “they have tormented men enough. Now 
they should get a taste of i.” 

She answered, “But what if the torment also reaches you? 
‘What have you gained then? You cannot leave all suffering to the 
Gods or else they will draw you into their torment. After all, they 
possess the power to do so. To be sure, I must confess that men 
100 possess a wondrous power over the Gods through their wits.” 

T answered, “I recognize that the torment of the Gods reached 
me; therefore I also recognize that I must yield to the Gods. What 
is their desire?” 

“They want obedience,” she replied. 

“So be it,” I answered, “but I fear their desire, therefore I say: 
I want to do what I can, On no account will I take back onto 
myself all the torment that I had to leave to the Gods, Not even 
Christ took torment away from his followers, but rather he heaped 
it on. I reserve conditions for myself, The Gods should recognize 
this and direct their desire accordingly. There is no longer any 
unconditional obedience, since man has stopped being a slave to 
the Gods. He has dignity before the Gods. He isa limb that even 
the Gods cannot do without. Giving way before the Gods is no 
more, So let their wish be heard. Comparison shall accomplish 
the rest so that each will have his appropriate part.” 

My soul answered, “The Gods want you to do for their sake 
what you know you do not want to do.” 

“I thought so,” I exclaimed, “of course that is what the Gods 
want. But do the Gods also do what I want? I want the fruits of 
my labor: What do the Gods do for me? They want their goals to 
be fulfilled, but what about mine?” 

This infuriated my soul and she said, “You are unbelievably 
defiant and rebellious. Consider the fact that the Gods are strong” 

“I know? I replied, “but no longer is there any unconditional 
obedience. When will they use their strength for me? They also 
‘want me to place mine in their service. What is their payment in 
kind? That they are tormented? Man suffered agony and the Gods 
were still not satisfied, but remained insatiable in their devising of 
new torments, They allowed man to become so blinded that 
he believed that there were no Gods, and that there was only 
‘one God who was a loving father, so that today someone who 
struggles with the Gods is even thought to be crazy. They have 
thus prepared this shame too for those who recognize them, out 
of boundless greed for power, since leading the blind is not easy. 
‘They will corrupt even their slaves.” 

“You do not want to obey the Gods?” my soul cried, astonished. 

1 answered, “I believe that has already gone on more than 
enough. Hence the Gods are insatiable, because they have 
received too many sacrifices: the altars of blinded humanity 
are streaming with blood. But dearth makes contentment, not 
abundance. May they learn dearth from men. Who does some- 
thing for me? That is the question that I must pose. In no case 
will I do what the Gods would have to do. Ask the Gods what 
they think of my suggestion.” 

‘Then my soul divided herself. As a bird she swooped up to the 
higher Gods and asa serpent she crawled down to the lower Gods. 
Soon afterward, she returned and said, troubled, “The Gods are 
outraged that you do not want to be obedient.” 

“That bothers me very little.” I replied, “I have done everything 
to placate the Gods. May they do their share now. Tell them. I can 
wait. I will lee no one tell me what to do. The Gods may devise a 
service in return. You can go. I will call you tomorrow so that you 
can tell me what the Gods have decided.” 


‘As my soul departed, I saw that she was shocked and worried, 
since she belonged to the race of the Gods and daimons and 
forever sought to convert me to their kind, as my humanity would 
like to convince me that I belong to the clan and must serve it. 
‘When I was asleep, my soul came again and in a dream cunningly 
painted me asa horned devil to terrify me and make me afraid of 
myself. In the following night, however, I called my soul and said 
to her, “Your trick was recognized. It is to no avail. You do not 
frighten me, Now speak and convey your message!” 

She answered, “The Gods give in, You have broken the 
compulsion of the law: Therefore I painted you as a devil, since he 
is the only one among the Gods who bows to no compulsion. He 
is the rebel against the eternal law, to which, thanks to his deed, 
there are also exceptions. Thus one does not necessarily have 
to. The devil is helpful in this respect. But it should not happen 
without seeking counsel from the Gods. This detour is necessary, 
or else you will fall prey to their law despite the devil.” 

Here the soul drew near to my ear and whispered, “The Gods 
are even happy to turn a blind eye from time to time, since 
basically they know very well that it would be bad for life if 
there were no exception to eternal law: Hence their tolerance of 
the devil.” 

She then raised her voice and cried loudly, “The Gods have 
mercy upon you and have accepted your sacrifice!” 

And so the devil helped me to cleanse myself from commingling 
in bondage, and the pain of one-sidedness pierced my heart and 
the wound of being torn apart scorched me. 


{15} It was noon on a hot summer's day and I was taking 
a stroll in my garden; when I reached the shade of the high 
trees, I met @IAHMON strolling in the frageant grass, But when 
1 sought to approach him, a blue shade" came from the other 
side, and when @IAHMON saw him, he said, “I find you in the 
garden, beloved. The sins of the world have conferred beauty 
upon your countenance 

“The suffering of the world has straightened your shape. 

“You are truly a king 

“Your crimson is blood. 

“Your ermine is snow from the coldness of the poles. 

“Your crown is the heavenly body of the sun, which you bear 
on your head.

“Welcome to the garden, my master, my beloved, my brother!” 

‘The shade replied, “Oh Simon Magus or whatever your name 
may be, are you in my garden or am I in yours?" 

IAHMON said, “You are, Oh master, in my garden. Helena, or 
whatever you choose to call her, and I are your servants, You can 
find accommodation with us. Simon and Helena have become 
®IAHMON and Baucis and so we are the hosts of the Gods. We 
granted hospitality to your terrible worm. And since you come 
forward, we take you in, It is our garden that surrounds you.”»* 

The shade answered, “Is this garden not mine? Is not the 
world of the heavens and of the spirits my own?” 

@IAHMON said, “You are, Oh master, here in the world of 
men. Men have changed. They are no longer the slaves and 
no longer the swindlers of the Gods and no longer mourn in 
your name, but they grant hospitality to the Gods. The terrible 
worm’ came before you, whom you recognize as your brother 
insofar as you are of divine nature, and as your father insofar as 
you are of human nature."* You dismissed him when he gave you 
clever counsel in the desert. You took the counsel, but dismissed 
‘the worm: he finds a place with us. But where he is, you will be 
also"* When I was Simon, I sought to escape him with the ploy 
‘of magic and thus I escaped you, Now that I gave the worm a 
place in my garden, you come to me,” 

The shade answered, “Do I fall for the power of your trick? 
Have you secretly caught me? Were not deception and lies always 
your manner?” 

But IAHMON answered, “Recognize, Oh master and beloved, 
that your nature is also of the serpent.” Were you not raised on 
the tree like the serpent? Have you laid aside your body, like the 
serpent its skin? Have you not practiced the healing arts, like the 
serpent? Did you not go to Hell before your ascent? And did you 
not see your brother there, who was shut away in the abyss?” 

‘Then the shade said, “You speak the truth. You are not lying. 
Even so, do you know what I bring you?” 

“This I know not,” @IAHMON answered, “I know only one 
thing, that whoever hosts the worm also needs his brother, 
What do you bring me, my beautiful guest? Lamentation 
and abomination were the gift of the worm. What will you 
give us?” 

The shade answered, “I bring you the beauty of suffering. That 
is what is needed by whoever hosts the worm.”

Epiloguet 


1959 
I worked on this book for 16 years. My acquaintance with alchemy in 


1930 took me away from it. The beginning of the end came in 1928, when 
Wilhelm sent me the text of the “Golden Flower,” an alchemical treatise. 
There the contents of this book found their way into actuality and I could 
no longer continue working on it. To the superficial observer, it will appear 
like madness. It would also have developed into one, had I not been able 
to absorb the overpowering force of the original experiences. With the 
help of alchemy, I could finally arrange them into a whole. I always knew 
that these experiences contained something precious, and therefore I 
knew of nothing better than to write them down ina “precious,” that is to 
say, costly book and to paint the images that emerged through reliving it 
all—as well as I could. I knew how frightfully inadequate this undertaking 
was, but despite much work and many distractions I remained true to it,

Enantiodromia of the life-type 


It is difficult to force this image to make a statement. Yet it is 
so allegorical that it ought to speak. It differs from the earlier 
experiences in that it is more witnessed than experienced. For that 
‘matter, all the images that I have placed under the title “Mystery 
play” are rather more allegorical than actual experiences. They are 
certainly not intended allegories; they have not been consciously 
contrived to depict experience in either veiled or even fantastic 
terms. Rather, they appeared as visions, Itwas not until I reworked 
them later that I realized more and more that they could in no 
way be compared with the experiences portrayed in the other 
chapters. These images apparently are portrayals of personified 
unconscious thoughts. That follows from their imagistic manner, 
They also called for more reflection and interpretation than the 
other experiences, to which I could not do justice with cogitation, 
because they were quite simply experiences. The images of the 
“Mystery play” on the other hand, personify principles accessible 
to thinking and intellectual understanding, and their allegorical 
manner accordingly also invites such an attempt at explanation. 

The action is set in a dark earthly depth, evidently an 
allegorical representation of the inner depths beneath the 
extension of the bright space of consciousness or the psychic field 
of vision. Sinking into such a depth corresponds to averting the 
mental gaze from outer things and focusing it on the inner dark 
depths. Gazing at the darkness to some extent animates the 
previously dark background. Since gazing at the darkness occurs 
‘without conscious expectation, the inanimate psychic background 
has an opportunity to let its contents appear, undisturbed by 
conscious assumptions 

The preceding experiences indicated that strong psychic 
movements were present that consciousness could not grasp. 
“Two figures—the old sage and the young maiden—step into the 
field of vision, unexpectedly for consciousness, but characteristic 
of the mythological spirit upon which consciousness rests. This 
configuration is an image that forever recurs in the human spirit. 
The old man represents a spiritual principle that could be desig- 
nated as Logos, and the maiden represents an unspicitual principle 
of feeling that could be called Eros. A descendent of Logos is 
Nous, the intellect, which has done away with the commingling 
of feeling, presentiment, and sensation. In contrast, the Logos 
contains this commingling. But it is not the product of such 
blending, or else it would be a lower animalistic psychic activity, 
yet it masters the blend, so that the four fundamental activities of 
the soul become subordinate to its principle. It is an independent 
principle of form that means understanding, insight, foresight, 
legislation, and wisdom. The figure of an old prophet is there- 
fore a fitting allegory for this principle, since the prophetic spirit 
unites in itself all these qualities. In contrast, Eros is a principle 
that contains a commingling of all the fundamental activities of 
the soul just as much as it masters them, although its purpose is 


completely different. It is not form-giving but form-fulflling; 
it is the wine that will be poured into the vessel; it is not the bed 
and direction of the stream but the impetuous water flowing in 
it. Eros is desire, longing, force, exuberance, pleasure, suffering 
‘Where Logos is ordering and insistence, Eros is dissolution and 
movement, They are two fundamental psychic powers that form 
a pair of opposites, each one requiring the other. 

The old prophet expresses persistence, but the young maiden 
denotes movement. Their impersonal essence is expressed by the 
fact that they are figures belonging to general human history; they 
do not belong to a person but have been a spiritual content of the 
world’s peoples since time immemorial. Everyone has them, and 
therefore these figures recur in the work of thinkers and poets. 

Such primordial images have a secret power that works just 
as much on human reason as on the soul, Wherever they appear 
they stir something linked with the mysterious, the long gone, 
and heavy with foreboding. A string sounds whose vibration 
reverberates in every man’s breast; these primordial images dwell 
in everyone as they are the property of all mankind? This secret 
power is like a spell, like magic, and causes elevation just as much 
as seduction. It is characteristic of primordial images that they 
take hold of man where he is utterly human, and a power seizes 
him, as if the bustling throng were pushing him. And this hap- 
pens even if individual understanding and feeling rise up against 
it. What is the power of the individual against the voice of the 
whole people in him? He is entranced, possessed, and consumed. 
Nothing makes this effect clearer than the serpent. It signifies 
everything dangerous and everything bad, everything nocturnal 
and uncanny, which adheres to Logos as well as to Eros, so long 
as they can work as the dark and unrecognized principles of the 
unconscious spirit. 

The house represents a fixed abode, which indicates that 
Logos and Eros have permanent residence in us. 

Salome is represented as the daughter of Elijah, thus 
expressing the order of succession. The prophet is her producer, 
she emanates from him, The fact that she is assigned to him as 
a daughter indicates a subordination of Eros to Logos. Although 
this relation is very frequent, as manifested by the constancy of 
this primordial image, it is nevertheless a special case that possesses 
no general validity. For if these were two opposed principles, 
cone could not arise from the other and thus depend on it. Salome 
is hence apparently no (complete) correct embodiment of Eros, 
but a variety of the same. (This supposition is later confirmed.) 
That she is actually an incorrect allegory for Eros also stems from 
the fact that she is blind. Eros is not blind, since he regulates, just 
as well as Logos does, all fundamental activities of the soul. The 
blindness indicates her incompleteness and the absence of an 
essential quality. By virtue of her shortcoming she depends upon 
her father, 

The indistinct glittering walls of the hall point to something 
unrecognized, perhaps something valuable that wakens curiosity 
and attracts attention, In this manner, creative involvement is 
‘woven even deeper into the image, so that an even greater anima- 
tion of the dark background becomes possible. Such enhanced 
attention gives rise to the image of an object, which to all intents 
and purposes expresses concentration, namely the image of a 
crystal, which has been used to produce such visions since time 
immemorial. These figures, which at first are incomprehensible 


to the beholder, evoke dark processes in his soul, which to a cer-

tain extent lie even deeper (such as in the vision of blood), and 
whose perception requires an aid like the crystal. As has been 
said, however, this expresses nothing else than an even stronger 
concentration of creative attention. 

A figure like the prophet, which is clear and complete in 
itself, arouses less curiosity than the unexpected form of blind 
Salome, which is why one may expect that the formative process 
will first address the problem of Eros. Hence an image of Eve 
appears first, together with images of the tree and the serpent. 
This apparently refers to temptation, as already encapsulated in 
the figure of Salome. Temptation brings about a further movement 
toward the side of Eros. This in turn forebodes many adventurous 
possibilities, for which the wandering of Odysseus is the fitting 
image. This image stimulates and invites adventurousness; it is 
asi a door opened to a new opportunity to free the gaze from the 
dark confinement and depths in which it was held fast. Hence 
the vision opens onto a sunny garden, whose red blooming 
trees represent a development of erotic feeling, and whose wells 
mean a steady source, The cool water of the well, which does 
not inebriate, indicates the Logos. (Therefore Salome also speaks 
later of the deep “wells” of the prophet) This suggests that the 
development of Eros also means a source of knowledge. And with 
this Elijah begins to speak. 

Logos undoubtedly has the upper hand in this, my case, since 
Elijah says that he and his daughter have always been one. Yet 
Logos and Eros are not one, but two. In this case, however, Logos 
has blinded and subjugated Eros, But if this is the case, then the 
necessity will also arise to free Eros from the clutch of Logos, so 
that the former will regain vision. Therefore Salome turns to me, 
because Eros is in need of help, and because I have apparently 
been enabled to behold this image for precisely this reason. The 
soul of the man is more inclined to Logos than to Eros, which is 
more characteristic of the essence of the woman, The subjugation 
of Eros through Logos explains not only the blindness of Eros but 
also the somewhat strange fact that Eros is represented precisely 
by the not-so-pleasing figure of Salome, Salome denotes bad 
qualities. She brings to mind not only the murder of the holy one 
but also the incestuous pleasure of the father. 

A principle always has the dignity of independence. But if 
this dignity is taken from it, it is debased and then assumes a 
bad form. We know that psychic activity and qualities that are 
deprived of development through repression degenerate and 
thus become bad habits. Either an open or secret vice takes the 
place of a well-formed activity and gives rise to a disunity of 
the personality with itself, signifying a moral suffering or a real 
sickness. Only one way remains open to whoever wants to free 
himself from this suffering: he must accept the repressed part of 
his soul, he must love his inferiority, even his vices, so that what 
is degenerate can resume development. 

‘Wherever Logos rules, there is order but too much persistence 
‘The allegory of paradise where there is no struggle and therefore 
no development is fitting here. In this condition the repressed 
movement degenerates and its value is lost. This is the murder 
of the holy one, and the murder happens because, like Herod, 
Logos cannot protect the holy one on account of his own weak- 
ness, because he can do nothing else than hold onto himself, thus 
inducing the degeneration of Eros. Only disobedience against 
the ruling principle leads out of this condition of undeveloped 
persistence, The story of paradise repeats itself, and hence the 


3 This corresponds wo pp. 245~248 above. 


serpent winds its way up the tree because Adam should be led 
into temptation, 

Every development leads through the undeveloped, but 
capable of development. In its undeveloped condition it is almost 
worthless, while development represents a highest value that is 
unquestionable. One must give up this value or atleast apparently. 
give it up to be able to attend to the undeveloped. But this stands 
in the sharpest contrast to the developed, which perhaps rep- 
resents our best and highest achievement. The acceptance of the 
undeveloped is therefore like a sin, like a false step, a degeneration, 
a descent to a deeper level; in actual fact, however, itis a greater 
deed than remaining in an ordered condition at the expense of the 
other side of our being, which is thus at the mercy of decay. 


Pp. 103-119" 


‘The scene of the action is the same place as in the first image. The 
allusion to a crater heightens the impression of a large cavity that 
reaches far down into the interior of the earth; this depth is not 
inactive, but violently discharges all kinds of matter, 

Since Eros poses the most serious problem at first, Salome 
centers the scene, blindly groping her way toward the lei. Even what 
appear to be negligible details are important in such visionary 
images. The left is the side of the inauspicious. This suggests that 
Eros does not tend toward the right, the side of consciousness, 
conscious will and conscious choice, but toward the side of the 
heart, which is less subject to our conscious will. This movement 
toward the left is emphasized by the fact that the serpent moves 
in the same direction. The serpent represents magical power, 
which also appears where animal drives are aroused imperceptibly 
in us. They afford the movement of Eros the uncanny emphasis 
that strikes us as magical. Magical effect is the enchantment and 
underlining of our thought and feeling through dark instinctual 
impulses of an animal nature. 

‘The movement toward the left is blind, chat is, without 
purpose and intention. It hence requires guidance, not by 
conscious intention but by Logos. Elijah calls Salome back. Her 
blindness is an affliction, and as such demands healing. Closer 
scrutiny at least partially invalidates the prejudice against her, 
She seems to be innocent, and perhaps her badness ought to be 
attributed to her blindness. 

Logos asserts its power over Eros by calling back Salome. The 
serpent also obeys Logos. It rests with Logos and Eros to emphasize 
the power and significance of this image. A natural consequence 
of this magical, powerful view of the union of Logos and Eros is 
the strongly felt smallness and insignificance of the I, which finds 
expression in a sense of boyishness, 

Tt appears as if the movement toward the left, following 
blind Eros, is not possible, or effectively disallowed, without the 
intervention of Logos. From the perspective of Logos, following 
a movement blindly is a sin, because it is one-sided and violates 
the law that man must forever strive for the highest degree of 
consciousness. Therein lies his humanity, The other he has in 
common with animals, Jesus also says, “If you know what you are 
doing, you are blessed: if you do not know what you are doing, 
you are damned.” The movement toward the left would be 
possible and permitted only if a conscious, seeing notion of it 
existed, Formulating such a notion is not possible without the 
intervention of Logos.

The first step toward developing such a notion is to become 
conscious of the goal or intention of the movement. Hence Elijah 
asks about the intention of the I. And it must admit its blindness, 
that is, its ignorance about intention. The only recognizable 
thing is a longing, a wish, to unravel the embroilment caused by 
the first image. 

Such making conscious stirs a vague sense of happiness in 
Salome. Understandably so, since consciousness means insight, 
that is, a healing of her blindness. Thus a step toward attaining 
the healing of Eros is taken. 

At first the I remains in its inferior position, since its ignorance 
prevents it from surveying the further development of its problem. 
Nor would it know which direction to take, since it has never 
cast its gaze into the depths of its psychic substratum, but has 
seen only what meets the eye and recognized only the powers 
of consciousness and the conscious world as effective forces, 
half-consciously denying its inner impulses. Faced with its own 
depths, such an I can only feel embarrassed. Its belief in a conscious 
upperworld had been so firm that going down into the depths of 
the self i like guilt, a betrayal of conscious ideals 

Bur since its desire to unravel the embroilment is greater than 
its aversion to its own inferiority, the I entrusts itself to the guidance 
of Logos. Since nothing comes into view that could answer the 
question raised, even greater depths must evidently be opened up. 
This in turn occurs with the help of the crystal, that is, through 
the utmost concentration of expectant attention, The first image 
to appear in the crystal is the mother of God with child. 

‘This image is obviously related, and opposed, to the vision of 
Eve in the first image. Just as Eve represents carnal temptation 
and carnal motherhood, the mother of God stands for carnal 
‘virginity and spiritual motherhood. The first direction would be 
a movement of Eros toward the flesh, the latter toward the spirit. 
Eve is an expression of the carnal side, whereas Mary expresses 
the spiritual side of Eros. As long as the I saw only Eve, it was 
blind. The evocation of awareness, however, affords a spiritual 
view of Eros. In the first case the I became an Odysseus on an 
adventurous journey, which concludes with the aging man’s 
return to Penelope, the motherly woman, 

In the latter case the I is depicted as Peter, the chosen rock 
upon which the Church is to be founded. The key as the symbol 
of the power of binding and loosing buttresses this idea, and 
leads one to the image of the pope as God's governor on earth 
with a threefold crown. 

Undoubtedly, the I becomes involved in a movement toward 
spiritual power, as attested by the one-sidedness of the movement. 
The vision of Eve leads astray, to adventurous odyssey, to Circe 
and Calypso. The vision of the mother of God, on the other 
hand, turns desire away from the flesh and toward the humble 
veneration of the spirit. Eros is subject to error in the flesh, but 
in the spirit it rises above the flesh and the inferiority of carnal 
error It therefore almost imperceptibly becomes the spirit, the 
power over the flesh in the guise of love, and thus spiritual power 
casts off the mantle of love; although the former believes it loves 
the spirit, in effect it rules the flesh. And the more powerful it is, 
the less loving it is. And the less it loves the spirit, the more it is 
carnal power. On account of its power over the flesh, the love of 
the spirit thus becomes a secular power-drive in spiritual guise. 

Christ overcame the world by burdening himself with its 
suffering, But Buddha overcame both the pleasure and suffering 
of the world by disposing of both. And thus he entered into 
nonbeing, a condition from which there is no return. Buddha 
is an even higher spiritual power, that derives no pleasure from 





APPENDIX B | 367 


controlling the flesh, since he has altogether moved beyond 
pleasure and suffering, Passion, whose conquest still requires so 
much effort in the case of Christ and does so incessantly and in 
ever greater measure, has left Buddha and surrounds him as a 
blazing fire. He is both unaffected and untouchable 

But if the living I approaches this condition, its passion may 
leave it, though it will not die, Or are we not our passion? And 
what happens to our passion when it leaves the I? The I is 
consciousness, which only has eyes in front. Tt never sees what 
is behind i, But that is where the passion it has overcome in 
front regroups. Unguided by the eye of reason, unmitigated 
by humaneness, the fire becomes a devastating, bloodthirsty 
Kali, who devours the life of man from within, as the mantra 
of her sacrificial ceremony says: “Hail to you, O Kali, triple- 
eyed Goddess of dreadful aspect, from whose throat hangs a 
necklace of human skulls. May you be honored with this blood!” 
Salome must of course despair of this end, which would like to 
turn Eros into spirit, since Eros cannot exist without the flesh. In 
resisting the inferiority of the flesh, the I resists its female soul, 
which represents everything that strives to suppress conscious 
ness, against spirit. Thus this path also results in an opposition. 
Hence the I returns from beholding the figures embodying 
its conflict. 

Logos and Eros are reunited, as if they had overcome the 
conflict between spirit and flesh. They appear to know the solution. 
‘The movement toward the left, which started from Eros at the 
beginning of the image, now commences from Logos. He starts 
moving toward the left, to complete with seeing eyes what began 
in blindness. At first this movement leads into greater darkness, 
which is then still somewhat illumined by the reddish light. The 
color red points to Eros. While it does not emit a bright light, 
Eros at least provides an opportunity to recognize something, 
perhaps even merely by inducing a situation in which man can 
recognize something, provided Logos assists him. 

Flijah leans against the marble lion. The lion as a royal animal 
signifies power. The stone suggests unshakeable firmness, 
thereby expressing the power and solidity of Logos. Once again 
awareness commences first, although now in.greater depths and 
in renewed surroundings. Here the I experiences its smallness 
even more as it is even further removed from the world it knows, 
where it is conscious of its value and meaning. In these new 
surroundings there is nothing to remind it of its meaning, Hence 
it is obviously overwhelmed by so much otherness, which so 
completely eludes its own discretion. Elijah assumes control of 
developing awareness. 

‘As the crystal visions have shown, the idea that should be 
conveyed to consciousness is an idea of spiritual power, that 
is, the T was tempted to arrogate prophethood. But this idea 
encountered such a feeling of resistance that it could not assert 
itself against consciousness. Hence it remained behind the 
curtain, But since the I could not follow Eros blindly, it sought 
at least to exchange spiritual power for this loss—as observed 
so very often in human life! It is almost inevitable that such a 
‘great loss, like that of Eros, presses man to search for a substitute 
at least in the sphere of power. This occurs in such an uncanny, 
cunning manner that the I mostly fails to notice the ruse, Which 
explains why the I as a rule cannot enjoy its power, since it does 
not possess power, but is possessed by the power-devil. In this 
case it would have been easy for the I to grasp the fact that Elijah 
imposes himself with such living reality, and lay claim to this 
figure as a personality valuable in itself, But awareness has 
forestalled this deception. 


368 | APPENDIX B 


The appearance of living figures should not be taken personally, 
even though one is obviously inclined to assume responsibility 
‘Yior them. In reality such figures belong just as much or little 
to our personality as our hands and feet. The mere presence of 
hands or feet is not characteristic of personality. If anything 
about them is characteristic, it is merely their individual character, 
It is thus characteristic of the I that the old man and the young 
maiden are called Elijah and Salome; they might just as well 
have been called Simon Magus and Helena, What is significant, 
however, is that they are biblical figures. As proven later, this is 
one of the peculiarities of the psychic entanglement belonging to 
this moment. 

The awareness of the alluring idea of spiritual power shifts 
the question of Eros into the foreground again, once more in a 
new form: both the possibility indicated by Eve and the one 
represented by Mary are ruled out. Hence the third possibility 
remains, namely filial relationship, which avoids the two extremes 
of the flesh and the spirit: Elijah as the father, Salome as the 
sister, the I as the son and brother. This solution corresponds to 
the Christian notion of childhood in God, Salome—as Mary— 
makes up the as-yet-absent mother in what is a formidably 
censnaring manner. This has a corresponding effect on the I. There 
is something undeniably cathartic about the Christian solution— 
because it seems to be altogether possible. There is a child in 
each of us; in the elderly, itis even the only thing still alive 
‘One can have recourse to the childlike anytime, on account of 
its inexhaustible freshness and adherence. Everything, even the 
most ominous, can be rendered harmless through retranslation 
into the childlike. After all, we do this often enough in everyday 
life, We even manage to tame a passion by leading it back to 
the childlike, and perhaps the flame of passion collapses in 
a childlike lament even more often. Thus there are many 
prospects for which the childlike can seem to be a satisfactory 
remedy, including not least the far-reaching effect of our 
Christian education, which hammers into us the notion of 
childhood in hundreds of mantras and hymns, 

Salome’s remark that Mary is their mother must thus appear 
even more devastating, Since this prevents the childlike solution 
from developing, it immediately prompts another thought: If 
Mary is the mother, then inescapably I must be Christ. The childlike 
solution would have canceled all reservations: Salome would 
no longer pose a threat, since she would be only the little 
sister. Elijah would be the caring father, whose wisdom and 
foresight would have left the I to its own devices with 
childlike trust. 

Bur this is the unfortunate drawback constituted by childhood 
asa solution: every child wishes to grow. Being a child involves 
the burning desire and impatience for future adulthood. If we 
return to being a child for fear of the dangers of Eros, the 
child will want to develop toward spiritual power. But if we flee 
into childhood for fear of the dangers of the spirit, we fall into 
arrogating the power of Eros. 

‘The condition of spiritual childhood constitutes a transition 
in which not everyone can remain. In this case it stands to 
reason that Eros demonstrates to the I the impossibility of 
being a child. One might think that it is not that awful to 
renounce the condition of childhood. But only those who 
fail to grasp the consequences of this renunciation think that 
way. It is not the loss of immemorial Christian views and the 
religious possibilities they ensured—many bear this loss all 100 
ceasily—but rather that what is renounced refers to the much more 
profound attitude that far transcends the Christian outlook, 








which provides individual life and thought with a tried and 
tested direction. Even if one has long abstained from Christian 
religious practice and has long ceased to regret this loss, one 
continues to behave intuitively as if the original views still 
existed by right. One fails to consider that a discarded world- 
view needs to be replaced by a new one; in particular one fails 
to be clear about the fact that renouncing the Christian outlook 
erodes present-day morals. Renouncing childhood means that 
no emotional or habitual dependence on hitherto valid moral 
views any longer exists, The hitherto valid view has arisen from 
the spirit of the Christian worldview: 

Notwithstanding all free thinking, our attitude to Eros, for 
instance, remains the old Christian view. We can now no longer 
bide our time peacefully without questioning and doubt, or else 
‘we will remain in the state of childhood. If we merely reject the 
dogmatic view, our liberation from the well-established will be 
merely intellectual, whereas our deeper feeling will persist on 
the old path. Most people, however, are unaware of how this sets 
them at odds with themselves, But later generations will become 
increasingly aware of this, Yet those who notice this will realize 
with horror that renouncing resumed childhood ousts them 
from our present times and that they can no longer follow any 
of the traditional ways. They enter uncharted territory, which 
has neither paths nor boundaries. They lack any direction, since 
they have forsaken all established bearings. This realization, 
however, dawns upon very few, since the vast majority makes do 
with half measures, and remains unperturbed by the stupidity of 
their spiritual condition, But then tepidity and slackness is not 
to everyone's taste, Some would rather abandon themselves to 
despair than adhere to a worldview completely removed from 
the well-trodden paths of their habitual behavior. They would 
rather venture into a pathless, dark land at the risk of perishing 
there, even if this should outrage all their cowardice. 

When Salome remarks that Mary is their mother, which 
means that the I is Christ, this means in brief that the I has 
left the state of Christian childhood and has taken the place of 
Christ. Nothing could be more absurd, of course, than to assume 
that the I thus would be presuming excessive importance; on 
the contrary, it takes up a decidedly inferior position. Previously 
it had the advantage of being part of the crowd rallying behind 
a powerful figure, but now it has exchanged that for solitude 
and forlornness, rendering it as alien and lonely in its world as 
Jesus was in his, without possessing that great man’s outstanding 
attributes. Being at odds with the world requires greatness, 
but the I experiences its almost ludicrous eagerness, Which 
explains its horror at Salome’s revelations. 

Whoever steps beyond the Christian outlook, yet does so 
definitely, falls into a seeming abyss, an utmost solitude, and 
lacks any means of hiding the fact. Of course one would like to 
persuade oneself that this is not all that bad, But it is 
‘Abandonment is about the worst thing that can happen to man's, 
herd instinct, not to mention the daunting task with which 
we thus burden ourselves. Destruction is easy, but rebuilding 
is difficult. 

Thus the image ends with a sense of gloom, which stands 
opposed, however, to the tall, quietly burning flame encircled 
by the serpent. This view denotes devotion coupled with the 
magical compulsion expressed by the serpent. Thus an effective 
counterpart is set against the disquieting sense of doubt and fear, 
as if someone were saying, “Of course your | is full of unease and 
doubt, but the constant flame of devotion burns in you more 
strongly and the compulsion of your fate is more powerful.” 


pp. 127-1508 


‘The far-reaching premonitions of the second image plunged the 
I into a chaos of doubt. Hence an understandable desire arose to 
rise above the confusion to attain greater clarity, as expressed in 
the image of the beetling mountain ridge. Logos appears to be 
leading the way. What occurs next is the image of two opposites, 
expressed by two serpents and the separation of day and night. 
Daylight signifies good, whereas darkness represents evil. As 
compelling forces, both assume the figure of serpents. Therein 
lies concealed an idea that subsequently assumes great importance: 
whoever encountered a black serpent would have been no less 
surprised at encountering a white one. Color does not dispel 
fear. What this suggests is that perhaps an equally dangerous, 
bewitching power resides in good as in evil. Essentially, che 
good needs to be regarded as an inherently no-less-dangerous 
principle than evil. In any event, the I could decide to approach 
the white serpent just as little as the black one, even though 


5 This refers to pp. 251-354, 


APPENDIX B | 369 


it believes it can or must by all means entrust itself more to 
good than to evil. But the I is rooted to the spot halfway, 
transfixed, and observes the struggle between the two principles— 
within itself 

The fact that the I remains in this middle position implies the 
advance of evil, since anything but unconditional surrender to the 
good impairs it. This finds expression in the attack of the black 
serpent. But the fact that the I does not partake of evil constitutes 
a victory for the good. This finds expression in the black serpent 
growing a white head, 

The disappearance of the serpent denotes that the opposition 
of good and evil has become ineffective, that is, that at least it has 
lost its immediate significance, For the I this means a release from 
the unconditional power of the hitherto abiding moral point 
of view in favor of a middle position freed from the pair of 
opposites, But neither clarity nor a clear view has been gained 
thereby; hence the ascent continues to the final point of elevation, 
which might grant the longed-for outlook. 


Appendix C 


‘The following is an entry from Black Book 5, which gives a 
preliminary sketch of cosmology of the Septem Sermones 


16. 1.16, 


The force of the God is frightful 

"You shall experience even more of it. You are in the second 
age. The first age has been overcome. This is the age of the 
rulership of the son, whom you call the Frog God. A third age will 
follow, the age of apportionment and harmonious power.” 

My soul, where did you go? Did you go to the animals? 

I bind the Above with the Below. I bind God and animal 
Something in me is part animal, something part God, and a third 
part human, Below you serpent, within you man, and above you 
God, Beyond the serpent comes the phallus, then the earth, then 
the moon, and finally the coldness and emptiness of outer space. 

Above you comes the dove or the celestial soul, in which 
love and foresight are united, just as poison and shrewdness are 
united in the serpent. Shrewdness is the devil’s understanding, 
which always detects smaller things and finds chinks where you 
suspect none. 

If [am not conjoined through the uniting of the Below and 
the Above, I break down into three parts: the serpent, and in that 
or some other animal form I roam, living nature daimonically, 
arousing fear and longing. The human soul, living forever within 
you. The celestial soul, as such dwelling with the Gods, far from 
you and unknowm to you, appearing in the form of a bird. Each of 
these three parts then is independent. 

Beyond me stands the celestial mother. Its counterpart is the 
phallus. Its mother is the earth, its goal is the heavenly mother. 

‘The celestial mother is the daughter of the celestial world. Its 
counterpart is the earth. 

The celestial mother is illuminated through the spiritual sun. 
Its counterpart is the moon. And just as the moon is the cross- 
ing to the dead of space, the spiritual sun is the crossing to the 
Pleroma, the upper world of fullness. The moon is the God's 
eye of emptiness, ust as the sun is the God's eye of fullness. The 
moon that you see is the symbol, just as the sun that you see. Sun 
and moon, that is, their symbols, are Gods. There are still other 
Gods; their symbols are the planets. 

The celestial mother is a daimon among the order of the Gods 
an inhabitant of the heavenly world 

“The Gods are favorable and unfavorable, impersonal, the souls of 
stars, influences, forces, grandfathers of souls, rulers in the heavenly 
world, both in space and in force, They are neither dangerous nor 
kind, strong, yet humble, clarifications of the Pleroma and of the 
eternal emptiness, configurations of the eternal qualities, 

‘Their number is immeasurably great and leads over to the one 
supreme fundamental, which contains all qualities in itself and 
itself has none, a nothing and everything, the complete dissolution 
of man, death and eternal life. 

Man becomes through the principium individuationis. He strives 
for absolute individuality, through which he ever increasingly 
concentrates the absolute dissolution of the Pleroma, Through 
this he makes the Pleroma the point that contains the greatest 


tension and is itself a shining star, immeasurably small, just as 
the Pleroma is immeasurably great. The more concentrated 
the Pleroma becomes, the stronger the star of the individual 
becomes, It is surrounded by shining clouds, a heavenly body in 
the making, comparable to a small sun. It emits fire. Therefore it 
is called: eyo [ey] coumdavot yuiv aomp. Just like the sun, which 
is also such a star, which is a God and grandfather of souls, the star 
of the individual is also like the sun, a God and grandfather of the 
souls, He is visible from time to time, just as I have described him. 

His light is blue, like that of a distant star. He is far out in space, 
cold and solitary, since he is beyond death. To attain individuality, 
wwe need a large share of death. Therefore itis called e eo eote,* 
since just as an innumerable number of men rule the earth, so a 
countless number of stars and of Gods rule the celestial world, 

To be sure, this God is the one who survives the death of men, 
‘To him for whom solitude is Heaven, he goes to Heaven; to him 
for whom it is Hell, he goes to Hell. Whoever does not follow 
the principium individuationis to its end becomes no God, since he 
cannot bear individuality 

The dead who besiege us are souls who have not fulfilled the 
principium individuationis, or else they would have become distant 
stars. Insofar as we do not fulfil it, the dead have a claim on us 
and besiege us and we cannot escape them. [Image) 

‘The God of the frogs or toads, the brainless, is the uniting of 
the Christian God with Satan. His nature is like the flame; he is 
like Eros, but a God; Eros is only a daimon, 

“The one God, to whom worship is due, isin the middle. 

“You should worship only one God. The other Gods are unimport- 
ant, Abraxas isto be feared. Therefore it was a deliverance when he 
separated himself from me. You do not need to seek him. He will 
find you, just like Eros. He is the God of the cosmos, extremely 
powerful and fearful. He is the creative drive, he is form and 
formation, just as much as matter and force, therefore he is 
above all the light and dark Gods, He tears away souls and casts 
them into procreation. He is the creative and created. He is the 
God who always renews himself, in days, in months, in years, in 
hhuman life, in ages, in peoples, in the living, in heavenly bodies 
He compels, he is unsparing. If you worship him, you increase his 
power over you. Thereby it becomes unbearable. You will have 
dreadful trouble getting clear of him. The more you free yourself 
from him, the more you approach death, since he is the life of 
the universe, But he is also universal death. Therefore you fall 
victim to him again, not in life but in dying So remember him, 
do not worship him, but also do not imagine that you can flee 
hhim since he is all around you. You must be in the middle of 
life, surrounded by death on all sides. Stretched out, like one 
crucified, you hang in him, the fearful, the overpowering. 

But you have in you the oxe God, the wonderfully beautiful 
and kind, the solitary, starlike, unmoving, he who is older and 
wiser than the father, he who has a safe hand, who leads you 
among all the darknesses and death scares of dreadful Abraxas. 
He gives joy and peace, since he is beyond death and beyond what 
is subject to change. He is no servant and no friend of Abraxas 
He himself is an Abraxas, but not unto you, but in himself and his 
distant world, since you yourself are a God who lives in faraway 
realms and who renews himself in his ages and creations and 
peoples, just as powerful to them as Abraxas is to you. 

‘You yourself are a creator of worlds and a created being

carved the continuation of this sentence on his stone at Bollingen 


2 "You are Gods” This is citation from John 10:34: "The Jews answered him, saying, for a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because tha thou, being 
‘aman, makesth thyself God. Jesus answered them, Ist not written in your law, I suid, Ye are gods” 


3 Sketch of Systeme Mundie: se Appendix A 


You have the one God, and you become your one God in the 
innumerable number of Gods. 

‘As a God, you are the great Abraxas in your world. But as a 
‘man you are the heart of the one God who appears to his world 
as the great Abraxas, the feared, the powerful, the donor of 
‘madness, he who dispenses the water of life, the spirit of the tree 
of life, the daimon of the blood, the death bringer. 

You are the suffering heart of your one star God, who is 
Abraxas to his world. 

Therefore because you are the heart of your God, aspire 
toward him, love him, live for him. Fear Abraxas, who rules over 
the human world. Accept what he forces upon you, since he is 
the master of the life of this world and none can escape him. If 
you do not accept, he will torment you to death and the heart of 
your God will suffer, just as the one God of Christ suffered the 
heaviest in his death. 

The suffering of mankind is without end, since its life is 
without end, Since there is no end where none sees an end. If 
mankind has come to an end, there is none who would see its 
end and none who could say that mankind has an end, So it has 
no end for itself, but it certainly does for the Gods. 

The death of Christ took no suffering away from the world, 
bur his life has taught us much; namely, that it pleases the 
one God if the individual lives his own life against the power of 
Abraxas. The one God thus delivers himself from the suffering 
of the earth into which his Eros plunged him; since when the 
one God saw the earth, he sought its procreation, and forgot 
that a world was already given to him in which he was Abraxas 
So the one God became human. Therefore the one in turn 
pulls man up to him and into him, so that the one becomes 
complete again. 

But the freeing of man from the power of Abraxas does not 
follow man’s withdrawing from the power of Abraxas—no one 
can pull away from it—but through subjugating himself to it. 
Even Christ had to subjugate himself to the power of Abraxas, 
and Abraxas killed him in a gruesome manner. 

Only by living life can you free yourself from it. So live it to 
such a degree that it befits you. To the degree that you live it, 
you also fall victim to the power of Abraxas and his dreadful 
deceptions. But to the same degree the star God in you gains 
in longing and power, in that the fruit of deception and human 
disappointment falls to him. Pain and disappointment fill the 
world of Abraxas with coldness, all of your life's warmth slowly 


APPENDIX. | 371 


sinks into the depths of your soul, into the midpoint of man, 
where the far blue starlight of your one God glimmers. 

Ifyou flee Abraxas from fear, you escape pain and disappoint- 
ment and you remain terrified, that is, out of unconscious love 
you cling to Abraxas and your one God cannot catch fire. But 
through pain and disappointment you redeem yourself, since 
your longing then falls of its own accord like a ripe fruit into the 
depths, following gravity, striving toward the midpoint, where 
the blue light of the star God arises. 

So do not flee from Abraxas, do not seek him. You feel 
his coercion, do not resist him, so that you shall live and pay 
your ransom. 

The works of Abraxas are to be fulfilled, for consider that in 
your world you yourself are Abraxas and force your creature to 
fulfil your work. Here, where you are the creature subjugated to 
Abraxas, you must learn to fulfill the work of life. There, where 
you are Abraxas, you compel your creatures. 

You ask, why is all this so? I understand that it seems 
questionable to you. The world is questionable. It is the unending 
infinite folly of the Gods, which you know is unendingly wise. 
Surely its also a crime, an unforgivable sin, and therefore also the 
highest love and virtue. 

So live life, do not flee Abraxas, provided that he compels you 
and you can recognize his necessity. In one sense I say to you: do 
not fear him, do not love him. In another sense I say: fear him, 
love him, He és the life of the earth, that says enough 

You need to recognize the multiplicity of the Gods, You 
cannot unite all into one being. As little as you are one with the 
multiplicity of men, just so little is the one God one with the 
multiplicity of the Gods. This one God is the kind, the loving, 
the leading, the healing. To him all your love and worship is due. 
“To him you should pray, you are one with him, he is near you, 
nearer than your soul. 

I, your soul, am your mother, who tenderly and frightfully 
surrounds you, your nourisher and corrupter; I prepare good 
things and poison for you. I am your intercessor with Abraxas. I 
teach you the arts that protect you from Abraxas. I stand between 
you and Abraxas the all-encompassing. I am your body, your 
shadow, your effectiveness in this world, your manifestation in 
the world of the Gods, your effulgence, your breath, your odor, 
your magical force. You should call me if you want to live with 
‘men, but the one God if you want to rise above the human world 
to the divine and eternal solitude of the star.
